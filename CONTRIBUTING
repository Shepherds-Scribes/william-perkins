# Thank you!

In the first place, thank you for your interest! Contributions are welcome. Please follow these guidelines:

## Transcription

The Transcription is intended to be as close as possible to the original text, without copying the layout exactly.

1. Attempt to preserve the original spelling, case, and punctuation wherever possible.
  - The long s (`ſ`) should be preserved in the transcript
2. Crop and preserve original illustrations alongside the transcription, embedding them with Markdown syntax.
3. Approximate layout with reasonable Markdown: given a single header with varying font size, e.g., prefer to represent it as a single header instead of trying to capture the font size variations.

## Modern Version

The Modern Version is intended to make reading easier, by updating spelling, punctuation, and formatting; and to respect the author's writing, by preserving intact as much of the original words and sentence structure as possible.

1. Use the Transcription draft as the starting point.
2. Update spelling, where appropriate, to King James English.
  - Convert ſ to s, normalize u and v, etc.
  - Permit archaic constructions such as "perisheth"
  - Update spellings such as "humilitie" -> "humility"
3. Normalize headings to Title Case or Sentence case where appropriate
4. Adjust punctuation and formatting, if needed, to make the intention clearer.
5. Do not replace words, paraphrase, etc. unless absolutely necessary.
