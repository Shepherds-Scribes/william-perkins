# Thank you!

In the first place, thank you for your interest! Contributions are welcome. Please follow these guidelines:

## Transcription

The Transcription is intended to be as close as possible to the original text, without copying the layout exactly.

1. Attempt to preserve the original spelling, case, and punctuation wherever possible.
  - The long s (`ſ`) should be preserved in the transcript
2. Crop and preserve original illustrations from the body of the work alongside the transcription, embedding them with Markdown syntax. The publisher's 
3. Prefer semantic markup rather than copying the layout: given a single header with varying font size, e.g., prefer to represent it as a single header instead of trying to capture the font size variations.
4. Proofread transcription once the copy is complete.
  - Check verse references; if you find a mistake, copy the original, but add a note like `[transcriber's note: likely intended Act 15. 9.]`

## Revision

The revised version is intended to make reading easier, by updating spelling, punctuation, and formatting; and to respect the author's writing, by preserving intact as much of the original words and sentence structure as possible.

1. Use the Transcription draft as the starting point.
2. Update spelling, where appropriate, to King James English.
  - Convert ſ to s, normalize u and v, etc.
  - Permit archaic constructions such as "perisheth"
  - Update spellings such as "humilitie" -> "humility"
3. Normalize headings to Title Case or Sentence case where appropriate
4. Fix punctuation, formatting, and typos, if needed.
5. Normalize Scripture references to the format `Book 1:2-3,6; Other Book 3:7`
  - If the original reference is a typo and the correct reference is clear, use the correct reference.
  - If the original reference is incorrect and the correct reference is uncertain or unclear, use the original reference, and copy the transcriber's note.
6. Do not replace words, paraphrase, etc. unless absolutely necessary.
