## Guidelines

The Transcription is intended to be as close as possible to the original text, without copying the layout exactly.

3. Prefer semantic markup rather than copying the layout: given a single header with varying font size, e.g., prefer to represent it as a single header instead of trying to capture the font size variations.
4. Proofread transcription once the copy is complete.
  - Check verse references; if you find a mistake, copy the original, but add a note like `[transcriber's note: likely intended Act 15. 9.]`
