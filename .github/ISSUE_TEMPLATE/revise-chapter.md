## Guidelines

The revised version is intended to make reading easier, by updating spelling, punctuation, and formatting; and to respect the author's writing, by preserving intact as much of the original words and sentence structure as possible.

1. Use the Transcription draft as the starting point.
2. Update spelling, where appropriate, to King James English.
  - Convert Å¿ to s, normalize u and v, etc.
  - Permit archaic constructions such as "perisheth"
  - Update spellings such as "humilitie" -> "humility"
3. Normalize headings to Title Case or Sentence case where appropriate
4. Correct punctuation, formatting, and typos, if needed.
5. Move footnotes to the end of the relevant sentence or sentence fragment.
6. Normalize Scripture references to the format `Book 1:2-3,6; Other Book 3:7`
  - If the original reference is a typo and the correct reference is clear, use the correct reference.
  - If the original reference is incorrect and the correct reference is uncertain or unclear, use the original reference, and copy the transcriber's note.
7. Do not replace words, paraphrase, etc. unless absolutely necessary.
