<p>Poor people, your manner is to soothe up yourselves, as though ye were in a most happy state: but if the matter come to a just trial, it will fall out far otherwise. For you lead your lives in great ignorance, as may appear by these your common opinions which follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>That faith is a man's good meaning, and his good serving of God.</li>
<li>That God is served by the rehearsing of the Ten Commandments, the Lord's Prayer, and the Creed.</li>
<li>That ye have believed in Christ ever since you could remember.</li>
<li>That it is pity that he should live which doth any whit doubt of his salvation.</li>
<li>That none can tell whether he shall be saved or no certainly: but that all men must be of a good belief.</li>
<li>That howsoever a man live, yet if he call upon God on his death-bed, and say, &quot;Lord have mercy upon me,&quot; and so go away like a lamb, he is certainly saved.</li>
<li>That if any be strangely visited, he is either taken with a planet, or bewitched.</li>
<li>That a man may lawfully swear, when he speaks nothing but the truth, and swears by nothing but that which is good, as by his faith, or troth.</li>
<li>That a preacher is a good man no longer than he is in the pulpit. (They think all like themselves.)</li>
<li>That a man may repent when he will, because the Scripture saith &quot;At what time soever a sinner doth repent him of his sins, &amp;c.&quot;</li>
<li>That it is an easier thing to please God than to please our neighbour.</li>
<li>That ye can keep the commandments as well as God will give you leave.</li>
<li>That it is the safest to do in Religion as most do.</li>
<li>That merry ballads and books, as &quot;Scoggin,&quot; &quot;Bevis of Southhampton,&quot; &amp;c. are good to drive away the time, and to remove heart-qualms.</li>
<li>That ye can serve God with all your hearts, and that ye would be sorry else.</li>
<li>That a man need not hear so many Sermons, except he could follow them better.</li>
<li>That a man which cometh at no Sermons, may as well believe, as he which hears all the Sermons in the world.</li>
<li>That ye know all the Preacher can tell you. For he can say nothing, but that every man is a sinner, that we must love our neighbours as ourselves, that every man must be saved by Christ: and all this ye can tell as well as he.</li>
<li>That it was a good world, when the old Religion was, because all things were cheap.</li>
<li>That drinking and bezeling in the ale-house or tavern, is good fellowship, and shews a good kind nature, and maintains neighbourhood.</li>
<li>That a man may swear by the Mass, because it is nothing now, and by the Lady, because she is gone out of the Country.</li>
<li>That every man must be for himself, and God for us all.</li>
<li>That a man may make of his own whatsoever he can.</li>
<li>That if a man remember to say his prayers every morning (though he never understand them) he hath blessed himself for all the day following.</li>
<li>That a man prayeth when he saith the Ten Commandments.</li>
<li>That a man eats his Maker in the Sacrament.</li>
<li>That if a man be no adulterer, no thief, no murderer, and do no man harm, he is a right honest man.</li>
<li>That a man need not have any knowledge of religion, because he is not book-learned.</li>
<li>That one may have a good meaning, when he saith and doth that which is evil.</li>
<li>That a man may go to wizards, called wise men, for counsel: because God hath provided a salve for every sore.</li>
<li>That ye are to be excused in all your doings, because the best men are sinners.</li>
<li>That ye have so strong a faith in Christ, that no evil company can hurt you.</li>
</ol>
<p>Those and such like sayings, what argue they but your gross ignorance? Now where ignorance reigneth, there reigns sin: and where sin reigns, there the devil rules: and where he rules, men are in a damnable case.</p>
<p>Ye will reply unto me thus: that ye are not so bad as I would make you. If need be you can say the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Commandments: and therefore ye will be of God's relief, say all men what they will, and you defy the devil from your hearts.</p>
<p>I answer again, that it is not sufficient to say all these without book, unless ye can understand the meaning of the words, and be able to make a right use of the Commandments, of the Creed, of the Lords Prayer by applying them inwardly to your hearts and consciences, and outwardly to your lives and conversations. This is the very point in which ye fail.</p>
<p>And for an help in this your ignorance, to bring you to true knowledge, unfeigned faith, and sound repentance, here I have set down the principal points of Christian religion in six plain and easy rules - even such as the simplest may easily learn - and hereunto is adjoined an exposition of them word by word. If ye do want other good directions, then use this my labour for your instruction. In reading of it, first learn the six Principles; and when you have them without book, and the meaning of them withal, then learn the exposition also: which being well conceived, and in some measure felt in the heart, ye shall be able to profit by Sermons, whereas now ye cannot; and the ordinary parts of the Catechism, namely the Ten Commandments, the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the institution of the two Sacraments, shall more easily be understood.</p>
<p>Thine in Christ Jesus,</p>

<em>Ephesians 4:17-18</em><br />
This I say therefore and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in vanity of their mind. Having their cogitation darkened, &amp; being strangers from the life of God, through ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart.<br />

<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is God?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> God is a spirit, <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#a">1</a></sup> or a spiritual substance, most wise, most holy, eternal, infinite.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How do you persuade your self that there is a God?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> Beside the testimony of the Scriptures, plain reason will shew it.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is one reason?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> When I consider the wonderful frame of the world, methinks the silly creatures that be in it could never make it: neither could it make itself, and therefore besides all these, the maker of it must needs be God. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#b">2</a></sup> Even as when a man comes into a strange country, and sees fair and sumptuous buildings, and yet finds no living creatures there besides birds and beasts, he will not imagine that either birds or beasts reared those buildings, but he presently conceives that some men either were or have been there.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What other reason have you?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> A man that commits any sin, as murder, fornication, adultery, blasphemy, &amp;c. albeit he doth so conceal the matter, that no man living know of it, yet oftentimes he hath a griping in his conscience, and feels the very flashing of hellfire; which is a strong reason to shew that there is a God, before whose judgement seat he must answer for his act. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#c">3</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How many Gods are there?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> No more but one. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#d">4</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How do you conceive this one God in your mind?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> Not by framing an image of him in my mind (as ignorant folks do, that think him to be an old man sitting in heaven) but I conceive him by his properties and works. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#e">5</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What be his chief properties?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> First, he is most wise, understanding all things aright, and knowing the reason of them. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#f">6</a></sup> Secondly, he is most holy, which appeareth, in that he is most just and merciful unto his creatures. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#g">7</a></sup> Thirdly, he is eternal, without either beginning or end of days. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#h">8</a></sup> Lastly, he is infinite, <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#i">9</a></sup> both because he is present in all places, and because he is of power sufficient to do whatsoever he will. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#k">10</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What be the works of God?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> The creation of the world, and every thing therein, and the preservation of them, being created by his special providence. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#l">11</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How know you that God governeth every particular thing in the world by his special providence?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> To omit the Scriptures, <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#m">12</a></sup> I see it by experience: meat, drink and clothing being void of heat and life, could not preserve the life of man, unless there were a special providence of God to give virtue unto them. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#n">13</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How is this one God distinguished?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> Into the Father, which begetteth the Son; <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#o">14</a></sup> into the Son, who is begotten of the Father; into the Holy Ghost, who proceedeth from the Father and the Son. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#p">15</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Q.</strong> Let us now come to ourselves, and first tell me: What is the natural estate of man?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> Every man is by nature dead in sin as a loathsome carrion, or as a dead corpse lieth rotting and stinking in the grave, having in him the seed of all sin. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#a">1</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is sin?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> Any breach of the law of God, if it be no more but the least want of that which the law requireth. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#b">2</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How many sorts of sin are there?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> Sin is either the corruption of nature, or any evil actions that proceed of it, as fruits thereof. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#c">3</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> In whom is the corruption of nature?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> In all men none excepted. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#d">4</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> In what part of man is it?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> In every part both of body and soul, like as a leprosy that runneth from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#e">5</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Shew me how every part of man is corrupted with sin?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> First, in the mind there is nothing but ignorance and blindness concerning heavenly matters. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#f">6</a></sup> Secondly, the conscience is defiled, being always either benumbed with sin, or else turmoiled with inward accusations and terrors. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#g">7</a></sup> Thirdly, the will of man only willeth and lusteth after evil. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#h">8</a></sup> Fourthly, the affections of the heart, as love, joy, hope, desire, &amp;c. are moved and stirred to that which is evil to embrace it, and they are never stirred unto that which is good, unless it be to eschew it. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#i">9</a></sup> Lastly, the members of the body are the instruments and tools of the mind for the execution of sin. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#k">10</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What be those evil actions that are the fruits of this corruption?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> Evil thoughts in the mind, which come either by a man's own conceiving, or by the suggestion of the devil; <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#l">11</a></sup> evil motions and lusts stirring in the heart; and from these arise evil words and deeds, when any occasion is given. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#m">12</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How cometh it to pass that all men are thus defiled with sin?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> By Adam's infidelity and disobedience, in eating the forbidden fruit: <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#n">13</a></sup> even as we see great personages by treason do not only hurt themselves, but also stain their blood, and disgrace their posterity.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What hurt comes to man by his sin?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> He is continually subject to the curse of God in his life time, in the end of his life, and after this life. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#o">14</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is the curse of God in this life?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> In the body, diseases, aches, pains; in the soul, blindness, hardness of heart, horror of conscience; in goods, hinderances, and losses; in name, ignominy and reproach; lastly, in the whole man, bondage under Satan the prince of darkness. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#p">15</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What manner of bondage is this?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> This bondage is when a man is the slave of the devil, and hath him to reign in his heart as his God. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#q">16</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How may a man know whether Satan be his God or not?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> He may know it by this, if he give obedience to him in heart, and express it in his conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> And how shall a man perceive this obedience?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> If he take delight in the evil motions that Satan puts into his heart, and do fulfill the lusts of the devil. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#r">17</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is the curse due to man in the end of this life?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> Death, which is the separation of body and soul. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#s">18</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is the curse after this life?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> Eternal damnation in hell fire, whereof every man is guilty, and is in as great danger of it as the traitor apprehended is in danger of hanging, drawing and quartering. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#t">19</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Q.</strong> If damnation be the reward of sin, then is a man of all creatures most miserable: a dog or a toad when they die, all their misery is ended; but when a man dieth, there is the beginning of his woe.<br />
<strong>A.</strong> It were so indeed, if there were no means of deliverance; but GOD hath shewed his mercy, in giving a Saviour to mankind.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How is this Saviour called?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> Jesus Christ. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#a">1</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is Jesus Christ?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> The eternal Son of God made man in all things, <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#b">2</a></sup> even in his infirmities like other men, save only in sin. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#c">3</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How was he made man void of sin?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> He was conceived in the womb of a Virgin, and sanctified by the Holy Ghost at his conception. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#d">4</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Why must our Saviour be both God and man?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> He must be a man, because man had sinned, and therefore a man must die for sin, to appease God's wrath; he must be God, to sustain &amp; uphold the manhood, to overcome and vanquish death. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#e">5</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What be the offices of Christ to make him an all-sufficient Saviour?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> He is a Priest, a Prophet, a King. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#f">6</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Why is he a Priest?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> To work the means of salvation in the behalf of mankind.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How doth he work the means of salvation?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> First, by making satisfaction to his Father for the sin of man; secondly, by making intercession. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#g">7</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How doth he make satisfaction?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> By two means: and the first is by offering a sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is the sacrifice?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> Christ himself, as he is a man consisting of body and soul. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#h">8</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is the Altar? <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#i">9</a></sup><br />
<strong>A.</strong> Christ as he is God, is the Altar on which he sacrificed himself.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Who was the Priest?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> None but Christ, and that as he is both God and man. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#k">10</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How oft did he sacrifice himself?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> Never but once. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#l">11</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What death did he suffer when he sacrificed himself?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> A death upon the cross, peculiar to himself alone: for besides the separation of body and soul, he felt also the pangs of hell, in that the whole wrath of God due to the sin of man was poured forth upon him. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#m">12</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What profit cometh by his Sacrifice?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> God's wrath is appeased by it. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#n">13</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Could the sufferings of Christ, which was but for a short time, countervail everlasting damnation, and so appease God's wrath?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> Yea; for seeing Christ suffered, God suffered, though not in his Godhead: and that is more then if all men in the world had suffered for ever and ever. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#o">14</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Now tell me the other means of satisfaction.<br />
<strong>A.</strong> It is the perfect fulfilling of the law.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How did he fulfill the law?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> By his perfect righteousness: <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#p">15</a></sup> which consisteth of two parts; the first, the integrity and pureness of his human nature: the other, his obedience in performing all that the law required. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#q">16</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> You have shewed how Christ doth make satisfaction; tell me likewise how he doth make intercession?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> He alone doth continually appear before his Father in heaven, <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#r">17</a></sup> making the faithful and all their prayers acceptable unto him, by applying of the merits of his own perfect satisfaction to them.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Why is Christ a Prophet?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> To reveal unto his Church the way and means of salvation, and this he doth outwardly by the ministry of his word, and inwardly by the teaching of his spirit. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#s">18</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Why is he also a King?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> That he might bountifully bestow upon us and convey unto us all the aforesaid means of salvation. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#t">19</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How doth he shew himself to be King?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> In that being dead and buried, he rose from the grave, quickened his dead body, ascended into heaven, and now sitteth at the right hand of his Father, with full power and glory in heaven. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#u">20</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How else?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> In that he doth continually inspire and direct his servants, by the divine power of his holy spirit, according to his holy word. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#v">21</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> But to whom will this blessed King communicate all these means of salvation?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> He offereth them to many, and they are sufficient to save all mankind; but all shall not be saved thereby, because by faith they will not receive them. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#w">22</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is faith?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> Faith is a wonderful grace of God, by which a man doth apprehend and apply Christ, and all his benefits unto himself. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#a">1</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How doth a man apply Christ unto himself, seeing we are on earth, and Christ in heaven?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> This applying is done by assurance, when a man is verily persuaded by the Holy Spirit of God's favour towards himself particularly and of the forgiveness of his own sins. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#b">2</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How doth God bring men truly to believe in Christ?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> First, he prepareth their hearts, that they might be capable of faith; and then he worketh faith in them.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How doth God prepare mens hearts?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> By bruising them, as if one would break an hard stone to powder: and this is done by humbling them. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#c">3</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How doth God humble a man?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> By working in him a sight of his sins, and a sorrow for them.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How is this sight of sin wrought?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> By the moral law: the sum whereof is the Ten Commandments. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#d">4</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What sins may I find in my self by them?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> Ten.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is the first?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> To make something thy God, which is not God: by fearing it, loving it, and so trusting in it more then in the true God. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#e">5</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is the second?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> To worship false gods, or the true God in a false manner. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#f">6</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is the third?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> To dishonour God in abusing his titles, words, and works. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#g">7</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is the fourth?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> To break the Sabbath, in doing the works of their calling and of the flesh; and in leaving undone the works of the spirit. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#h">8</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What be the six latter?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> To do any thing that may hinder thy neighbour's dignity, <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#i">9</a></sup> life, <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#k">10</a></sup> chastity, <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#l">11</a></sup> wealth, <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#m">12</a></sup> good name, <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#n">13</a></sup> though it be but in the secret thoughts and motions of the heart unto which thou givest no liking nor consent. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#o">14</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is sorrow for sin?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> It is when a man's conscience is touched with a lively feeling of God's displeasure for any of these sins: <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#p">15</a></sup> in such wise, that he utterly despairs of salvation, in regard of anything in himself, acknowledging that he hath deserved shame and confusion eternally. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#q">16</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How doth God work this sorrow?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> By the terrible curse of the law.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is that?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> He which breaks but one of the commandments of God, though it be but once in all his lifetime, and that only in one thought, is subject to and in danger of eternal damnation thereby. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#r">17</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> When men's hearts are thus prepared, how doth God ingraft faith in them?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> By working certain inward motions in the heart, which are the seeds of faith, out of which it breedeth.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is the first of them?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> When a man humbled under the burden of his sins doth acknowledge and feel that he stands in great need of Christ. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#s">18</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is the second?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> An hungering desire and a longing to be made partaker of Christ and all his merits. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#t">19</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is the third?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> A flying to the throne of grace from the sentence of the law pricking the conscience. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#u">20</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How is it done?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> By praying, with sending up loud cries for God's favour in Christ, in the pardoning of sin; and with fervent perseverance herein, till the desire of the heart be granted. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#x">21</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What followeth after this?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> God then according to his merciful promise, lets the poor sinner feel the assurance of his love wherewith he loveth him in Christ, which assurance is a lively faith. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#y">22</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Are there divers degrees and measures of true faith?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> Yea. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#z">23</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is the least measure of true faith that any man can have?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> When a man of an humble spirit, by reason of the littleness of his faith, doth not yet <em>feel</em> the assurance of the forgiveness of his sins, and yet he is persuaded that they are pardonable; and therefore desireth that they should be pardoned, and with his heart prayeth to God to pardon them. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#aa">24</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How do you know that such a man hath faith?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> These desires and prayers are testimonies of the Spirit, <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#ab">25</a></sup> whose property it is to stir up a longing and a lusting after heavenly things, with sighs and groans for God's favour and mercy in Christ. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#ac">26</a></sup> Now where the Spirit of Christ is, there is Christ dwelling; and where Christ dwelleth, there is true faith, how weak soever it be.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is the greatest measure of faith?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> When a man daily increasing in faith comes to be fully persuaded of God's love in Christ towards himself <em>particularly</em>, and of the forgiveness of his own sins. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#ad">27</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> When shall a Christian heart come to this full assurance?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> Not at the first, but in some continuance of time, when he hath been well practised in repentance; <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#ae">28</a></sup> and hath had divers experiences of God's love unto him in Christ: then after them will appear in his heart the fullness of persuasion; which is the ripeness and strength of faith. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#af">29</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What benefits doth a man receive by faith in Christ?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> Hereby he is justified before God, and sanctified. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#ag">30</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is this, to be justified before God?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> It comprehendeth two things: the first, to be cleared from the guiltiness and punishment of sin; the second, to be accepted as perfectly righteous before God. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#ah">31</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How is a man cleared from the guiltiness and punishment of his sins?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> By Christ's sufferings and death upon the cross. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#ai">32</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How is he accepted for righteous before God?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> By the righteousness of Christ imputed to him. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#ak">33</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What profit comes by being thus justified?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> Hereby and by no other means in the world, the believer shall be accepted before God's judgement seat, as worthy of eternal life by the merits of the same righteousness of Christ. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#al">34</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Do not good works then make us worthy of eternal life?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> No: For God, who is perfect righteousness itself, will find in the best works we do more matter of damnation then of salvation: and therefore we must rather condemn ourselves for our good works, than look to be justified before God thereby. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#am">35</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How may a man know that he is justified before God?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> He need not ascend into heaven to search the secret counsel of God: but rather descend into his own heart to search whether he be sanctified or not. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#an">36</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is it to be sanctified?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> It comprehendeth two things: the first, to be purged from the corruption of his own nature; the second, to be endowed with inward righteousness.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How is the corruption of sin purged?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> By the merits and power of Christ's death, which being by faith applied is as a corrosive to abate, consume, and weaken the power of all sin. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#ao">37</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How is a man indued with inherent righteousness?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> Through the virtue of Christ's resurrection: which being applied by faith, is as a restorative to revive a man that is dead in sin, to newness of life. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#ap">38</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> In what part of man is sanctification wrought?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> In every part of body and soul. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#aq">39</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> In what time is it wrought?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> It is begun in this life, in which the faithful receive only the first fruits of the Spirit, and it is not finished before the end of this life. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#ar">40</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What graces of the Spirit do usually shew themselves in the heart of a man sanctified?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> The hatred of sin, and the love of righteousness. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#as">41</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What proceeds of them?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> Repentance, which is a settled purpose in the heart, with a careful endeavour to leave all his sins, and to live a Christian life, according to all God's commandments. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#at">42</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What goeth with repentance?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> A continual fighting and struggling against the assaults of a man's own flesh, against the motions of the devil, and the enticements of the world.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What followeth after a man hath gotten the victory in any temptation or affliction?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> Experience of God's love in Christ, and so increase of peace of conscience, and joy in the Holy Ghost. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#au">43</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What followeth if in any temptation he be overcome and through infirmity fall?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> After a while there will arise a godly sorrow, which is when a man is grieved for no other cause in the world, but for this only, that by his sin he hath displeased God, who hath been unto him a most merciful and loving Father. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#ax">44</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What sign is there of this sorrow?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> The true sign of it is this, when a man can be grieved for the very disobedience of God in his evil word or deed, though he should never be punished, and though there were neither heaven nor hell. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#ay">45</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What follows after this sorrow?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> Repentance renewed afresh. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#az">46</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> By what signs will this repentance appear?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> By seven. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#ba">47</a></sup> </p>
<ol>
<li>A care to leave the sin into which he is fallen. </li>
<li>An utter condemning of himself for it, with a craving of pardon. </li>
<li>A great anger against himself for his carelessness. </li>
<li>A fear lest he should fall into the same sin again. </li>
<li>A desire ever after to please God. </li>
<li>A zeal of the same. </li>
<li>Revenge upon himself for his former offence.</li>

<p><strong>Q.</strong> What outward means must we use to obtain faith, and all the blessings of God which come by faith?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> The preaching of God's word, and the administration of the Sacraments, and prayer. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#a">1</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Where is the word of God to be found?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> The whole word of God, needful to salvation, is set down in the holy Scriptures.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How know you that the Scriptures are the word of God, and not men's policies?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> I am assured of it: first because the Holy Ghost persuadeth my conscience that it is so. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#b">2</a></sup> Secondly, I see it by experience: for the preaching of the Scriptures have the power of God in them to humble a man, when they are preached, and to cast him down to hell, and afterward to restore and raise him up again. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#c">3</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is the use of the word of God preached?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> First, it breedeth, and then it increaseth faith in them which are chosen to salvation; but unto them that perish, it is by reason of their corruption an occasion of their further damnation. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#d">4</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How must we hear God's word, that it may be effectual to our salvation?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> We must come unto it with hunger-bitten hearts, having an appetite to the word; we must mark it with attention, receive it by faith, submit ourselves unto it with fear and trembling, even when our faults are reproved: Lastly, we must hide it in the corners of our hearts, that we may frame our lives and conversations by it. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#e">5</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is a Sacrament?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> A sign to represent, a seal to confirm, an instrument to convey Christ and all his benefits to them that do believe in him. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#f">6</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Why must a Sacrament represent the mercies of God before our eyes?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> Because we are dull to conceive and to remember them.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Why do the Sacraments seal unto us the mercies of God?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> Because we are full of unbelief, and doubting of them.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Why is the Sacrament the instrument of the spirit to convey the mercies of God into our hearts?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> Because we are like Thomas; we will not believe till we feel them in some measure in our hearts.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How many Sacraments are there?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> Two and no more: Baptism, by which we have our admission into the true Church of God, and the Lord's Supper, by which we are nourished and preserved in the true Church after our admission. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#g">7</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is done in Baptism?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> In the assembly of the Church the covenant of grace between God and the party baptized is solemnly confirmed and sealed. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#h">8</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> In this covenant, what doth God promise to the party baptized?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> Christ, with all blessings that come by him. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#i">9</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> To what condition is the party baptized bound?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> To receive Christ, and to repent his sin. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#k">10</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What meaneth the sprinkling or dipping in water?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> It seals unto us remission of sins, and sanctification by the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Christ. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#l">11</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How cometh it to pass, that many after their baptism for a long time feel not the effect and fruit of it, and some never?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> The fault is not in God, who keeps his covenants, but the fault is in themselves, in that they do not keep the condition of the covenant, to receive Christ by faith, and to repent of all their sins.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> When shall a man then see the effect of his baptism?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> At what time soever he doth receive Christ by faith, though it be many years after, he shall then feel the power of God to regenerate him, and to work all things in him, which he offered in baptism. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#m">12</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How if a man never keep the condition to which he bound himself in baptism?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> His damnation shall be the greater, because he breaketh his vow made to God. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#n">13</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is done in the Lord's Supper?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> The former covenant, solemnly ratified in baptism, is renewed in the Lord's Supper, between the Lord himself and the receiver. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#o">14</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Who is the receiver?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> Every one that hath been baptized, and after his baptism hath truly believed in Christ, and repented of his sins from his heart. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#p">15</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What meaneth the bread and wine, the eating of the bread and drinking of the wine?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> These outward actions are a second seal, set by the Lord's own hand unto his covenant. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#r">16</a></sup> And they do give every receiver to understand that as God doth bless the bread and wine, to preserve and strengthen the body of the receiver, so Christ apprehended and received by faith shall nourish him, and preserve both body and soul unto eternal life.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What shall a true receiver feel in himself after the receiving of the Sacrament?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> The increase of his faith in Christ, the increase of sanctification, a greater measure of dying to sin, a greater care to live in newness of life. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#s">17</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What if a man after the receiving of the sacrament, never find any such thing in himself?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> He may well suspect himself whether he did ever repent or not: and thereupon is to use means to come to sound faith and repentance.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is another means of increasing faith?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> Prayer.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is prayer?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> A familiar speech with God in the name of Christ, <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#t">18</a></sup> in which either we crave things needful, or give thanks for things received. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#u">19</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> In asking things needful, what is required?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> Two things, an earnest desire, and faith.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What things must a Christian man's heart desire? <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#v">20</a></sup><br />
<strong>A.</strong> Six things especially.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What are they?<br />
<strong>A.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>That he may glorify God. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#w">21</a></sup></li>
<li>That God may reign in his heart, and not sin. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#x">22</a></sup></li>
<li>That he may do God's will, and not the lusts of his flesh. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#y">23</a></sup></li>
<li>That he may rely himself on God's providence for all the means of this temporal life. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#z">24</a></sup></li>
<li>That he may be justified, and be at peace with God. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#aa">25</a></sup></li>
<li>That by the power of God he may be strengthened against all temptations. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#ab">26</a></sup></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is faith?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> A persuasion that those things which we truly desire, God will grant them for Christ's sake. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#ac">27</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Q.</strong> After that a man hath led a short life in this world, what followeth then?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> Death, which is the parting asunder of body and soul.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Why do wicked men &amp; unbelievers die?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> That their bodies may go to the earth, and their souls may be cast into hell fire. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#a">1</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Why do the godly die, seeing Christ by death hath overcome death?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> They die for this end, that their bodies may rest for a while in the earth, and their souls may enter into heaven immediately. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#b">2</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What followeth after death?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> The day of judgement.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What sign is there to know this day from other days?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> Heaven and earth shall be consumed with fire immediately before the coming of the judge. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#c">3</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Who shall be judge?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> Jesus Christ the Son of God.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What shall be the coming to judgement?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> He shall come in the clouds in great majesty and glory, with infinite company of Angels. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#d">4</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How shall a man be cited to judgement?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> At the sound of a trumpet, <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#e">5</a></sup> the living shall be changed in the twinkling of an eye, and the dead shall rise again every one with his own body: <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#f">6</a></sup> and all shall be gathered together before Christ; and after this, the good shall be severed from the bad, these standing on the left hand of Christ, the other on the right. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#g">7</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How will Christ try and examine every man's cause?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> The books of every man's doings shall be laid open, <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#h">8</a></sup> men's consciences shall be made either to accuse them, or excuse them, and every man shall be tried by the works which he did in his life time, because they are open and manifest signs of faith or unbelief. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#i">9</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What sentence will he give?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> Hee will give sentence of salvation to the elect and godly, but he will pronounce sentence of damnation against unbelievers and reprobates. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#k">10</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What state shall the godly be in after the day of judgement?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> They shall continue for ever in the highest heaven in the presence of God, having fellowship with Christ Jesus, and reigning with him for ever. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#l">11</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What state shall the wicked be in after the day of judgement?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> In eternal perdition and destruction in hell fire.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is that?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> It stands in three things especially: <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#m">12</a></sup> </p>
<ol>
<li>First, a perpetual separation from God's comfortable presence. </li>
<li>Secondly, fellowship with the devil and his angels. </li>
<li>Thirdly, an horrible pang and torment both of body and soul, arising of the feeling of the whole wrath of God, poured forth on the wicked for ever, world without end; and if the pain of one tooth for one day be so great, endless shall be the pain of the whole man, body and soul for ever.</li>
