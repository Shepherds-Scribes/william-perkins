<p>Hitherto we have spoken of the perfection of God's nature. Now followeth the life of God, by which the divine nature is in perpetual action, living, and moving in itself. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Psalm 42:2<br />
My soul thirsteth for God, even for the living God, when shall I come and appear before the presence of God?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hebrews 3:12<br />
See there be not at any time in any of you an evil heart to depart from the living God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The divine nature is especially in perpetual operation by three attributes, the which do manifest the operation of God towards his creatures. These are his wisdom, will, and omnipotence.</p>
<p>The wisdom or knowledge of God is that by the which God doth - not by certain notions abstracted from the things themselves, but by his own essence; nor successively and by discourse of reason, but by one eternal and immutable act of understanding - distinctly and perfectly know himself, and all other things, though infinite, whether they have been or not. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matthew 11:27<br />
No man knoweth the Son but the Father, nor the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hebrews 4:13<br />
There is nothing created, which is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and open to his eyes, with whom we have to do. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Psalm 147:5<br />
His wisdom is infinite.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God's wisdom hath these parts: his foreknowledge, and his counsel.</p>
<p>The foreknowledge of God is that by which he most assuredly foreseeth all things that are to come. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Acts 2:23<br />
Him have ye taken by the hands of the wicked, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, and have crucified and slain.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Romans 8:29<br />
Those which he knew before, he also predestinated to be made like to the image of his Son.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not properly spoken of God, but by reason of men, to whom things are past or to come.</p>
<p>The counsel of God is that by the which he doth most rightly perceive the best reason of all things that are done. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Proverbs 8:14<br />
I have counsel and wisdom, I am understanding, and I have strength.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The will of God is that by the which he both most freely and justly, with one act, willeth all things. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Romans 9:18<br />
He hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ephesians 1:5<br />
Who hath predestinated us to be adopted through Jesus Christ unto himself, according to the good pleasure of his will.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>James 4:15<br />
For that which you should say, If the Lord will, and we live we will doe this or that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God willeth that which is good, by approving it; that which is evil, inasmuch as it is evil, by disallowing and forsaking it. And yet he voluntarily doth permit evil; because it is good that there should be evil.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Acts 14:16<br />
Who in time past suffered all the Gentiles to walk in their own ways.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Psalm 81:12<br />
So I gave them up to the hardness of their heart, and they have walked in their own counsels.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The will of God, by reason of divers objects, hath divers names, and is either called Love and Hatred, or Grace and Justice.</p>
<p>The love of God is that by the which God approveth first himself, and then all his creatures as they are good, without their desert, and in them doth take delight. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 John 4:16<br />
God is love, and whoso remaineth in love, remaineth in God, and God in him.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>John 3:16<br />
So God loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son... </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Romans 5:8<br />
God setteth out his love towards us, seeing that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The hatred of God is that by the which he disliketh and detesteth his creature offending, for his fault. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 Corinthians 10:5<br />
But many of them the Lord misliked, for they perished in the wilderness. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Psalm 5:5<br />
Thou hatest all the workers of iniquity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Psalm 45:7<br />
Thou hast loved justice and hated iniquity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The grace of God is that by which he freely declareth his favour to his creatures.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Romans 11:6<br />
If it be of grace, it is no more of works: otherwise grace is not grace; but if it be of works it is no more grace.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Titus 2:11-12 <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup><br />
The saving grace of God shined to all men, teaching us to deny impiety...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The grace of God is either his goodness, or his mercy.</p>
<p>The goodness of God is that by which he, being in himself absolutely good, doth freely exercise his liberality upon his creatures. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matthew 19:17<br />
Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, even God.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Matthew 5:45<br />
He maketh Sun to shine upon the good and bad, and he raineth upon the just and unjust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God's mercy is that by which he freely assisteth all his creatures in their miseries.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Isaiah 30:18<br />
Yet will the Lord wait, that he may have mercy upon you. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lamentations 3:22<br />
It is the Lord's mercy that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Exodus 33:19<br />
I take pity on whom I take pity, and am merciful to whom I am merciful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God's justice is that by which he in all things willeth that which is just.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Psalm 11:7<br />
The just Lord loveth justice.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Psalm 5:4<br />
For thou art not a God that loveth wickedness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God's justice is in word or deed.</p>
<p>Justice in word is that truth by which he constantly and indeed willeth that which he hath said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Romans 3:4<br />
Let God be true, and every man a liar.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Matthew 24:35<br />
Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my word shall not pass away. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence it is, that there is a certain justice of God in keeping his promise. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 John 1:9<br />
If we confess our sins, God is faithful and just to forgive our sins.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2 Timothy 4:8<br />
Henceforth is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Justice in deed is that by which he either disposeth or rewardeth.</p>
<p>God's disposing justice is that by which he, as a most free Lord, ordereth rightly all things in his actions. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Psalm 145:17<br />
The Lord is righteous in all his ways.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God's rewarding justice is that by which he rendereth to his creature according to his work. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>2 Thessalonians 1:6-7 <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup><br />
It is justice with God, to render affliction to such as afflict you, but to you which are afflicted, releasing with us. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>1 Peter 1:17<br />
Therefore if you call him Father, which without respect of person judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your dwelling here in fear.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Jeremiah 51:56<br />
The Lord that recompenseth, shall surely recompense.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The justice of God is either his gentleness or anger.</p>
<p>God's gentleness is that by which he freely rewardeth the righteousness of his creature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2 Thessalonians 1:5<br />
Which is a token of the righteous judgement of God, that ye may be counted worthy the kingdom of God, for the which ye also suffer.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Matthew 10:41,42<br />
He that receiveth a Prophet, in the name of a Prophet, shall have a Prophet's reward: and he that receiveth a righteous man, in the name of a righteous man, shall have the reward of a righteous man. And whosoever shall give unto one of these little ones to drink a cup of cold water only in the name of a Disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God's anger is that by which he willeth the punishment of the creature offending. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Romans 1:18<br />
For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness, and unrighteousness of men, which withhold the truth in unrighteousness.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>John 3:36<br />
He that obeyeth not the Son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus much concerning the will of God; now followeth his omnipotence.</p>
<p>God's omnipotence is that by which he is most able to perform every work. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matthew 19:26<br />
With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some things notwithstanding are here to be excepted. First, those things whose action argueth an impotence, as to lie, to deny his word. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Titus 1:2<br />
Which God, that cannot lie, hath promised.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2 Timothy 2:13 <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3">3</a></sup><br />
He cannot deny himself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Secondly, such things as are contrary to the nature of God, as to destroy himself, and not to beget his Son from eternity. Thirdly, such things as imply contradiction. For God cannot make a truth false; or that which is when it is not, to be.</p>
<p>God's power may be distinguished into an absolute and actual power.</p>
<p>God's absolute power is that by which he can do more than he either doth or will do. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matthew 3:9<br />
I say unto you, God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Philippians 3:21<br />
According to the working, whereby he is able to subdue even all things to himself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God's actual power is that by which he causeth all things to be, which he freely willeth. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Psalm 135:6<br />
All things which God will, those he doth in heaven, and in earth, and in all depths.</p>
