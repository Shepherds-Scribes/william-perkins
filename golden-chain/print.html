<p>Christian Reader, there are at this day four several opinions of the order of God's predestination. The first is of the old and new Pelagians; who place the causes of God's predestination in man, in that they hold that God did ordain men either to life or death, according as he did foresee that they would, by their natural free will, either reject or receive grace offered. The second of them, who (of some) are termed Lutherans; which teach that God, foreseeing how all mankind being shut up under belief would therefore reject grace offered, did hereupon purpose to choose some to salvation of his mere mercy, without any respect of their faith or good works; and the rest to reject, being moved to do this because he did eternally foresee that they would reject his grace offered them in the Gospel. The third Semi-Pelagian Papists, which ascribe God's predestination partly to mercy, and partly to mens foreseen preparations and meritorious works. The fourth, of such as teach that the cause of the execution of God's predestination is his mercy in Christ, in them which are saved; and in them which perish, the fall and corruption of man: yet so as that the decree and eternal counsel of God, concerning them both, hath not any cause besides his will and pleasure. Of these four opinions, the three former I labour to oppugn, as erroneous, and to maintain the last, as being truth, which will bear weight in the balance of the Sanctuary.</p>
<p>A further discourse whereof, here I make bold to offer to thy godly consideration: in reading whereof, regard not so much the thing itself penned very slenderly, as mine intent and affection: who desire among the rest, to cast my mite into the treasury of the Church of England, and, for want of gold, pearl, and precious stone, to bring a ram's skin or twain, and a little goats' hair, to the building of the Lord's tabernacle (Exodus 35:23).</p>
<p>The Father of our Lord Jesus Christ grant, that according to the riches of his glory, thou mayest be strengthened by his spirit in the inner man, that Christ may dwell in thy heart by faith; to the end that thou being rooted and grounded in love, mayest be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the breadth, and length, and height thereof; and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge, that thou mayest be filled with all fullness of God. Amen.</p>
<p>Farewell. July 23, the year of the last patience of Saints, 1592.</p>

<p>The Body of Scripture is a doctrine sufficient to live well.</p>
<p>It comprehendeth many holy sciences, whereof one is principal, others are handmaids or retainers.</p>
<p>The principal science is <em>Theology</em>.</p>
<p><em>Theology</em> is the science of living blessedly for ever. Blessed life ariseth from the knowledge of God: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>John 17:3<br />
This is life eternal, that they know thee to be the only very God, and whom thou hast sent Christ Jesus.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Isaiah 53:11<br />
By his knowledge shall my righteous servant <em>(viz. Christ)</em> justify many.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And therefore it ariseth likewise from the knowledge of ourselves, because we know God by looking into ourselves.</p>
<p><em>Theology</em> hath two parts: the first of God, the second of his works.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="of-god-and-the-nature-of-god"><a class="header" href="#of-god-and-the-nature-of-god">Of God, and the Nature of God.</a></h1>
<p>That there is a God, it is evident:</p>
<ol>
<li>By the course of nature; </li>
<li>By the nature of the soul of man; </li>
<li>By the distinction of things honest and dishonest; </li>
<li>By the terror of conscience; </li>
<li>By the regiment of civil societies; </li>
<li>The order of all causes having ever recourse to some former beginning; </li>
<li>The determination of all things to their several ends; </li>
<li>The consent of all men well in their wits.</li>
</ol>
<p>God is Jehovah Elohim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exodus 6:2-3<br />
And Elohim spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am Jehovah: and I appeared unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name <em>Jehovah,</em> was I not known unto them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Exodus 3:13-15 <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup><br />
If they say unto me, what is his name? What shall I say unto them? And God answered Moses, <em>I am that I am:</em> Also he said, thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, <em>I am</em> hath sent me unto you. And God spake further to Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, <em>Jehovah Elohim...</em> hath sent me unto you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In these words, the first title of God declareth his Nature, the second his Persons.</p>
<p>The nature of God, is his most lively and most perfect essence.</p>
<p>The perfection of the nature of God, is the absolute constitution thereof, whereby it is wholly complete within itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exodus 3:14 <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup><br />
I am that I am,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Acts 17:24-25 <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3">3</a></sup><br />
God that made the world, and all things that are therein, seeing that he is the Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands, neither is worshipped with mens' hands, <em>as though he needed any thing;</em> seeing he giveth to all life and breath, and all things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The perfection of his nature, is either simpleness, or the infiniteness thereof.</p>
<p>The simpleness of his nature, is that by which he is void of all logical relation in arguments. He hath not in him subject or adjunct.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>John 5:26<br />
As the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself...</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>John 14:6<br />
I am the way, the truth, and the life.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>1 John 1:5,7 
God is <em>light,</em> and in him is no darkness... But if we walk in the light, as he is light...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence it is manifest that to have life, and to be life: to be in light, and to be light, in God are all one. Neither is God subject to generality, or speciality; whole, or parts; matter or that which is made of matter: for so there should be in God divers things, and one more perfect than another. Therefore, whatsoever is in God, is his essence, and all that he is, he is by essence. The saying of Augustine in his 6th book and 4th chapter of the Trinity, is fit to prove this: &quot;In God,&quot; saith he, &quot;to be, and to be just or mighty, are all one: but in the mind of man, it is not all one to be, and to be mighty, or just: for the mind may be destitute of these virtues, and yet a mind.&quot;</p>
<p>Hence it is manifest that the nature of God is immutable and spiritual.</p>
<p>God's immutability of nature, is that by which he is void of all composition, division, and change: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>James 1:17<br />
With God there is no variableness nor shadow of changing. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Malachi 3:6<br />
I am the Lord, and am not changed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where it is said that God repenteth, &amp;c. (Genesis 6:6) the meaning is, that God changeth the action, as men do that repent: therefore repentance signifieth not any mutation in God, but in his actions, and such things as are made and changed by him.</p>
<p>God's nature is spiritual, in that it is incorporeal, and therefore invisible. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>John 4:24<br />
God is a Spirit </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2 Corinthians 3:17<br />
The Lord is the spirit.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>1 Timothy 1:17<br />
To the King eternal, immortal, invisible only wise God, be glory and honor for ever and ever.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Colossians 1:15<br />
Who is the image of the invisible God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The infiniteness of God is twofold: his eternity, and exceeding greatness.</p>
<p>God's eternity, is that by which he is without beginning and ending.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Psalm 90:2<br />
Before the mountains were made, and before thou hadst formed the earth and the round world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art our God. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Revelation 1:8<br />
I am <em>Alpha</em> and <em>Omega,</em> that is, the beginning and ending, saith the Lord: Which is, Which was, and Which is to come.</p>

<p>God's exceeding greatness, is that by which his incomprehensible nature is everywhere present, both within and without the world. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Psalm 145:3<br />
Great is the Lord and worthy to be praised and his greatness is incomprehensible.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>1 Kings 8:27<br />
Is it true indeed that God will dwell on the earth? Behold the heavens, and the heavens of heavens are not able to contain thee: how much less is this house that I have built?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Jeremiah 23:24<br />
Do not I fill the heaven and earth, saith the Lord?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence it is plain.</p>
<p>First, that he is only one, and that indivisible, not many: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ephesians 4:5<br />
One Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Deuteronomy 4:35<br />
Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the Lord he is God, and that there is none but he alone.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>1 Corinthians 8:4 
We know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And there can be but one thing infinite in nature.</p>
<p>Secondly, that God is the knower of the heart. For nothing is hidden from that nature, which is within all things, and without all things, which is included in nothing, nor excluded from anything. Because: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 Kings 8:39<br />
The Lord searcheth all hearts, and understandeth every work of the mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Psalm 139:2 <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#4">4</a></sup><br />
Thou knowest my sitting down, and my rising up, thou understandest my cogitation afar off.</p>
