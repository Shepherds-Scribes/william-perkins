# The first Principle expounded.

*Q.* What is God?  
*A.* God is [^a] a *spirit,* or a ſpirituall ſubſtance, moſt wiſe, moſt holy, eternall, infinite.

*Q.* How doe you perſwade your ſelfe that there is a God?  
*A.* Beſide the teſtimonie of the Scriptures, plaine reaſon will ſhew it.

*Q.* What is one reaſon?  
*A.* When I conſider [^b] the wonderfull frame of the world, me thinkes the ſilly creatures that bee in it could neuer make it: neither could it make it ſelfe, and therefore beſides all theſe, the maker of it muſt needes be God. Euen as when a man comes into a ſtrange country, & ſees faire and ſumptuous buildings, and yet findes no liuing creatures there, beſides birds and beaſts, he will not imagine, that either birds or beaſts reared thoſe buildings, but hee preſently conceiues, that ſome men either were or haue been there.

*Q.* What other reaſon haue you?  
*A.* [^c] A man that commits any ſinne, as murther, fornication, adulterie, blaſphemie, &c. albeit hee doth ſo conceale the matter, that no man liuing know of it, yet oftentimes he hath a griping in his conſcience, and feeles the very flaſhing of hellfire; which is a ſtrong reaſon to ſhew, that there is a God, before whoſe iudgement ſeat he muſt anſwer for his fact.

*Q.* How many Gods are there?  
*A.* No [^d] more but one.

*Q.* How doe you conceiue this one God in your minde?  
*A.* Not [^e] by framing an image of him in my mind (as ignorant folkes doe, that thinke him to bee an old man ſitting in heauen) but I conceiue him by his properties and workes.

*Q.* What bee his cheife properties?  
*A.* Firſt, hee is [^f] *moſt wiſe,* vnderſtanding all things aright, and knowing the reaſon of them. Secondly, he is [^g] moſt *holy,* which appeareth, in that he is *moſt iuſt* and *mercifull* vnto his creatures. Thirdly, hee is [^h] *eternall,* without either beginning, or end of daies. Laſtly, he is [^i] *infinite,* both becauſe he is preſent in all places, and becauſe hee is of power ſufficient to doe whatſoeuer he [^k] *will.*

*Q.* What be the workes of God?  
*A.* [^l] The creation of the world, and euery thing therein, and the preſeruation of them, being created by *his ſpeciall prouidence.*

*Q.* How know you that God gouerneth euery particular thing in the world by his *ſpeciall prouidence?*  
*A.* To omit the [^m] Scriptures, I ſee it by experience: [^n] Meate, Drinke and Clothing being voide of heat & life, could not preſerue the life of man, vnleſſe there were a *ſpeciall prouidence* of God to giue vertue vnto them.

*Q.* How is this one God diſtinguiſhed?  
*A.* [^o] Into the *Father*, which begetteth the Sonne; into the *Sonne*, who is begotten of the Father; into the *holy Ghoſt,* [^p] who proceedeth from the Father and the Sonne.
