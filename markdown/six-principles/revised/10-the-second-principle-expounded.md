# The Second Principle Expounded.

*Q.* Let us now come to ourselves, and first tell me what is the natural estate of man?  
*A.* Every man is by nature [^a] *dead* in sin as a loathsome carrion, or as a dead corpse lieth rotting and stinking in the grave, having in him the seed of all sin.

*Q.* What is sin?  
*A.* Any [^b] breach of the law of God, if it be no more but the least want of that which the law requireth.

*Q.* How many sorts of sin are there?  
*A.* Sin is either the [^c] corruption of nature, or any evil actions that proceed of it, as fruits thereof.

*Q.* In whom is the corruption of nature?  
*A.* In all men [^d] none excepted.

*Q.* In what part of man is it?  
*A.* In every [^e] part both of body and soul, like as a leprosy that runneth from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot.

*Q.* Shew me how every part of man is corrupted with sin?  
*A.* First, in the [^f] mind there is nothing but ignorance and blindness concerning heavenly matters. Secondly, [^g] the conscience is defiled, being always either benumbed with sin, or else turmoiled with inward accusations and terrors. Thirdly, [^h] the will of man only willeth and lusteth after evil. Fourthly, the [^i] affections of the heart, as love, joy, hope, desire, &c. are moved and stirred to that which is evil to embrace it, and they are never stirred unto that which is good, unless it be to eschew it. Lastly, the [^k] members of the body are the instruments & tools of the mind for the execution of sin.

*Q.* What be those evil actions that are the fruits of this corruption?  
*A.* [^l] Evil thoughts in the mind, which come either by a mans own conceiving, or by the suggestion of the devil: [^m] evil motions and lusts stirring in the heart, and from these arise evil words and deeds, when any occasion is given.

*Q.* How cometh it to pass that all men are thus defiled with sin?  
*A.* By [^n] Adam's infidelity and disobedience, in eating the forbidden fruit: even as we see great personages by treason do not only hurt themselves, but also stain their blood, and disgrace their posterity.

*Q.* What hurt comes to man by his sin?  
*A.* [^o] He is continually subject to the curse of God in his life time, in the end of his life, and after this life.

*Q.* What is the curse of God in this life?  
*A.* [^p] In the body, diseases, aches, pains: in the soul, blindness, hardness of heart, horror of conscience; in goods, hinderances, and losses: in name ignominy and reproach: lastly, in the whole man, bondage under Satan the prince of darkness.

*Q.* What manner of bondage is this?  
*A.* This bondage [^q] is when a man is the slave of the devil, and hath him to reign in his heart as his God.

*Q.* How may a man know whether Satan be his God or not?  
*A.* He may know it by this, if he give obedience to him in heart, and express it in his conversation.

*Q.* And how shall a man perceive this obedience?  
*A.* If he [^r] take delight in the evil motions that Satan puts into his heart, and do fulfill the lusts of the devil.

*Q.* What is the curse due to man in the end of this life?  
*A.* [^s] Death, which is the separation of body and soul.

*Q.* What is the curse after this life?  
*A.* [^t] Eternal damnation in hell fire, whereof every man is guilty, and is in as great danger of it as the traitor apprehended is in danger of hanging, drawing and quartering.
