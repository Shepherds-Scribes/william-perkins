# The Second Principle Expounded.

**Q.** Let us now come to ourselves, and first tell me: What is the natural estate of man?  
**A.** Every man is by nature dead in sin as a loathsome carrion, or as a dead corpse lieth rotting and stinking in the grave, having in him the seed of all sin. [^a]

**Q.** What is sin?  
**A.** Any breach of the law of God, if it be no more but the least want of that which the law requireth. [^b]

**Q.** How many sorts of sin are there?  
**A.** Sin is either the corruption of nature, or any evil actions that proceed of it, as fruits thereof. [^c]

**Q.** In whom is the corruption of nature?  
**A.** In all men none excepted. [^d]

**Q.** In what part of man is it?  
**A.** In every part both of body and soul, like as a leprosy that runneth from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot. [^e]

**Q.** Shew me how every part of man is corrupted with sin?  
**A.** First, in the mind there is nothing but ignorance and blindness concerning heavenly matters. [^f] Secondly, the conscience is defiled, being always either benumbed with sin, or else turmoiled with inward accusations and terrors. [^g] Thirdly, the will of man only willeth and lusteth after evil. [^h] Fourthly, the affections of the heart, as love, joy, hope, desire, &c. are moved and stirred to that which is evil to embrace it, and they are never stirred unto that which is good, unless it be to eschew it. [^i] Lastly, the members of the body are the instruments and tools of the mind for the execution of sin. [^k]

**Q.** What be those evil actions that are the fruits of this corruption?  
**A.** Evil thoughts in the mind, which come either by a man's own conceiving, or by the suggestion of the devil; [^l] evil motions and lusts stirring in the heart; and from these arise evil words and deeds, when any occasion is given. [^m]

**Q.** How cometh it to pass that all men are thus defiled with sin?  
**A.** By Adam's infidelity and disobedience, in eating the forbidden fruit: [^n] even as we see great personages by treason do not only hurt themselves, but also stain their blood, and disgrace their posterity.

**Q.** What hurt comes to man by his sin?  
**A.** He is continually subject to the curse of God in his life time, in the end of his life, and after this life. [^o]

**Q.** What is the curse of God in this life?  
**A.** In the body, diseases, aches, pains; in the soul, blindness, hardness of heart, horror of conscience; in goods, hinderances, and losses; in name, ignominy and reproach; lastly, in the whole man, bondage under Satan the prince of darkness. [^p]

**Q.** What manner of bondage is this?  
**A.** This bondage is when a man is the slave of the devil, and hath him to reign in his heart as his God. [^q]

**Q.** How may a man know whether Satan be his God or not?  
**A.** He may know it by this, if he give obedience to him in heart, and express it in his conversation.

**Q.** And how shall a man perceive this obedience?  
**A.** If he take delight in the evil motions that Satan puts into his heart, and do fulfill the lusts of the devil. [^r]

**Q.** What is the curse due to man in the end of this life?  
**A.** Death, which is the separation of body and soul. [^s]

**Q.** What is the curse after this life?  
**A.** Eternal damnation in hell fire, whereof every man is guilty, and is in as great danger of it as the traitor apprehended is in danger of hanging, drawing and quartering. [^t]
