# The Fourth Principle.

**Q.** But how mayest thou be made partaker of Christ and his benefits?  
**A.** A man of a contrite and humble spirit, by faith alone apprehending and applying Christ with all his merits unto himself, is justified before God and sanctified.

1. A man of a contrite and humble spirit.
  > *Isaiah 57:15*  
  > For thus saith he that is high and excellent; He that inhabiteth the eternity, whose name is the Holy one, I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit; to revive the spirit of the humble, and to give life to them that are of a contrite heart.  
  > *Psalm 51:17*  
  > The sacrifices of God, are a contrite spirit, a contrite and a broken heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
2. By faith alone.
  > *Mark 5:36*  
  > As soon as Jesus heard that word spoken, he said unto the ruler of the Synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.  
  > *Numbers 21:9*  
  > So Moses made a serpent of brass, and set it up for a sign, and when a serpent had bitten a man, then he looked to the Serpent of brass, and lived.  
  > *John 3:14-15*  
  > And as Moses lift up the Serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up. That whosoever believeth in him, should not perish, but have eternal life.
3. Apprehending and applying Christ with all his merits unto himself.
  > *John 1:12*  
  > But as many as received him, to them he gave power to be the sons of God, to them that believe in his name.  
  > *John 6:35*  
  > And Jesus said unto them; I am the bread of life, he that cometh to me, shall not hunger, and he that believeth in me, shall never thirst.
4. Is justified before God.
  > *Romans 4:3,6-7*  
  > For what saith the Scripture; Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness... Even as David declareth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness, without works: saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.
5. And sanctified.
  > *Acts 15:9*  
  > And he put no difference between us and them, after that by faith he had purified their hearts.  
  > *1 Corinthians 1:30*  
  > But ye are of him in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.
