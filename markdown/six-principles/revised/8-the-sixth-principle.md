# The Sixth Principle.

*Q.* What is the state of all men after death?
*A.* All men shall rise again with their own bodies, to the last judgement, which being ended, the godly shall possess the kingdom of heaven: but unbelievers and reprobates shall be in hell, tormented with the devil and his angels for ever.

1. All men shall rise again with their own bodies.
  > John 5:28-29  
  > Marvel not at this, for the hour shall come, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice. And they shall come forth that have done good, unto the resurrection of life: but they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of condemnation.
2. To the last judgement.
  > Ecclesiastes 12:14  
  > For God will bring every work unto judgement, with every secret thing, whether it be good or evil.  
  > Matthew 12:36  
  > But I say unto you, that of every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give an account thereof, at the day of judgement.
3. Which being ended the godly.
  > 2 Peter 2:7  
  > And delivered just Lot, vexed with the unclean conversation of the wicked.  
  > Ezekiel 9:4  
  > And the Lord said unto him: go through the midst of the City, even through the midst of Jerusalem, & set a mark upon the forehead of them that mourn, and cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof.
4. Shall possess the kingdom of God.
  > Matthew 25:34  
  > Then shall the king say to them on his right hand, Come yee blessed of my Father, inherit ye the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world.
5. But unbelievers and reprobates shall be in hell, tormented with the devil and his angels.
  > Matthew 25:41. Then shall he say unto them on the left hand, Depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire, which is prepared for the devil & his angels.

The Scriptures for proof were only quoted by the Author, to move thee to search them: the words themselves I have expressed at the earnest request of many, that thou mayest more easily learn them: if yet thou wilt be ignorant, thy malice is evident; if thou gainest knowledge, give God the glory in doing of his will. *Thine* T.S.
