# The Sixth Principle Expounded.

*Q.* After that a man hath led a short life in this world, what followeth then?  
*A.* Death, which is the parting asunder of body and soul.

*Q.* Why do wicked men & unbelievers die?  
*A.* That their bodies may go to the earth, and their [^a] souls may be cast into hell fire.

*Q.* Why do the godly die, seeing Christ by death hath overcome death?  
*A.* They die for this end, that [^b] their bodies may rest for a while in the earth, and their souls may enter into heaven immediately.

*Q.* What followeth after death?  
*A.* The day of judgement.

*Q.* What sign is there to know this day from other days?  
*A.* [^c] Heaven and earth shall be consumed with fire immediately before the coming of the judge.

*Q.* Who shall be judge?  
*A.* Jesus Christ the Son of God.

*Q.* What shall be the coming to judgement?  
*A.* He shall come [^d] in the clouds in great majesty and glory, with infinite company of Angels.

*Q.* How shall a man be cited to judgement?  
*A.* At the [^e] sound of a trumpet, the living shall be changed in the twinkling of an eye, and the dead shall rise again every one with [^f] his own body: and all shall be gathered together before Christ; and after this, the good shall be severed from the bad, [^g] these standing on the left hand of Christ, the other on the right.

*Q.* How will Christ try and examine every man's cause?  
*A.* The [^h] books of every man's doings shall be laid open, men's consciences shall be made either to accuse them, or excuse them, and every man shall be tried by the works which he did in his life time, because they are open and manifest signs [^i] of faith or unbelief.

*Q.* What sentence will he give?  
*A.* Hee will give [^k] sentence of salvation to the elect and godly, but he will pronounce sentence of damnation against unbelievers and reprobates.

*Q.* What state shall the godly be in after the day of judgement?  
*A.* They shall [^l] continue for ever in the highest heaven in the presence of God, having fellowship with Christ Jesus, and reigning with him for ever.

*Q.* What state shall the wicked be in after the day of judgement?  
*A.* In eternal perdition and destruction in hell fire.

*Q.* What is that?  
*A.* It [^m] stands in three things especially: First, a perpetual separation from God's comfortable presence. Secondly, fellowship with the devil and his angels. Thirdly, an horrible pang and torment both of body and soul, arising of the feeling of the whole wrath of God, poured forth on the wicked for ever world without end; and if the pain of one tooth for one day be so great, endless shall be the pain of the whole man, body and soul for ever.
