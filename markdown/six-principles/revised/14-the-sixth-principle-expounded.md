*Q.* After that a man hath led a ſhort life in this world, what followeth then?  
*A.* Death, which is the parting aſunder of body and ſoule.

*Q.* Why do wicked men & vnbeleeuers dy?  
*A.* That their bodies may goe to the earth. and their [^a] ſoules may be caſt into hell fire.

*Q.* Why do the godly die, ſeeing Chriſt by death hath ouercome death?  
*A.* They die for this end, that [^b] their bodies may reſt for a while in the earth, & their ſoules may enter into heauen immediately.

*Q.* What followeth after death?  
*A.* The day of iudgement.

*Q.* What ſigne is there to know this day from other daies?  
*A.* [^c] Heauen and earth ſhall be conſumed with fire immediately before the comming of the iudge.

*Q.* Who ſhall be iudge?  
*A.* Ieſus Chriſt the Sonne of God.

*Q.* What ſhal be the cóming to iudgement?  
*A.* Hee ſhall come [^d] in the cloudes in great maieſtie and glorie, with infinite company of Angels.

*Q.* How ſhall a man be cited to iudgement?  
*A.* At the [^e] ſound of a trumpet, the liuing ſhall be changed in the twinckling of an eye, and the dead ſhall riſe againe euerie one with [^f] his owne bodie: and all ſhall be gathered together before Chriſt; and after this, the good ſhall be ſeuered fró the bad, [^g] theſe ſtáding on the left hand of Chriſt, the other on the right.

*Q.* How will Chriſt trie and examine euery mans cauſe?  
*A.* The [^h] bookes of euery mans doings ſhall be laid open, mens conſciences ſhall be made either to accuſe them, or excuſe them, and euery man ſhall be tried by the workes which he did in his life time, becauſe they are open and manifeſt ſignes [^i] of faith or vnbeliefe.

*Q.* What ſentence will he giue?  
*A.* Hee will giue [^k] ſentence of ſaluation to the elect and godly, but he will pronounce ſentence of damnation againſt vnbeleeuers and reprobates.

*Q.* What ſtate ſhall the godly be in after the day of iudgement?  
*A.* They ſhall [^l] continue for euer in the higheſt heauen in the preſence of God, hauing fellowſhip with Chriſt Ieſus, and reigning with him for euer.

*Q.* What ſtate ſhall the wicked be in after the day of iudgement?  
*A.* In eternall perdition and deſtruction in hell fire.

*Q.* What is that?  
*A.* It [^m] ſtands in three things eſpecially: Firſt, a perpetuall ſeparation from Gods comfortable preſence. Secondly, fellowſhip with the diuell and his angels. Thirdly, an horrible pang and torment both of body and ſoule, ariſing of the feeling of the whole wrath of God, powred forth on the wicked for euer world without end; and if the paine of one tooth for one day be ſo great, endleſſe ſhall be the paine of the whole man, body and ſoule for euer.
