# The Fifth Principle.

**Q.** What are the ordinary or usual means for obtaining of faith?  
**A.** Faith cometh only by the preaching of the word, and increaseth daily by it: as also by the administration of Sacraments and prayer.

1. Faith cometh only by the preaching of the word, and increaseth daily by it.
  > *Romans 10:14*  
  > But how shall they call on him, in whom they have not believed: how shall they believe in him, of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a Preacher?  
  > *Proverbs 29:18*  
  > Where there is no vision, the people decay; but he that keepeth the law is blessed.  
  > *Hosea 4:6*  
  > My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast refused knowledge, I will also refuse thee, that thou shalt be no Priest to me: and seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.
2. As also by the administration of the Sacraments.
  > *Romans 4:11*  
  > After he received the sign of circumcision, as the seal of the righteousness of faith, which he had when he was uncircumcised, that he should be the father of all them that believe, not being circumcised, that righteousness might be imputed to them also.  
  > *1 Corinthians 10:1*  
  > Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, &c.
3. And Prayer.
  > *Romans 10:13*  
  > For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
