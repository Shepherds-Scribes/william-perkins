*Proofs out of the word of God.*

1. There is a God.
  > Romans 1:20  
  > For the invisible things of him, that is, his eternal power & Godhead, are seen by the creation of the world, being considered in his works, to the intent, that they should be without excuse.  
  > Acts 14:17  
  > Nevertheless, he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food & gladness.
2. This God is one.
  > 1 Corinthians 8:4  
  > Concerning therefore meat sacrificed to Idols, we know that an Idol is nothing in the world: and that there is none other God but one.
3. He is Creator of all things.
  > Genesis 1:1  
  > In the beginning God created the heauen and the earth.  
  > Hebrews 11:3  
  > Through faith we understand, that the world was ordained by the word of God: so that the things which we see, are not made of things which did appear.
4. He is governor of all things.

  > The eyes of the Lord in every place behold the evil and the good.  
  > Matthew 10:30

5. Distinguished into the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
  > Matthew 3:16-17  
  > And Jesus when he was baptized came straight out of the water: and lo, the heavens were opened unto him, & John saw the spirit of God descending like a Dove and lighting upon him. And lo a voice came from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.  
  > 1 John 5:7
