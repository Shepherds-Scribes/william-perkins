# The Third Principle.

**Q.** What means is there for thee to escape this damnable state?  
**A.** Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, being made man, by his death upon the Cross, and by his righteousness, hath perfectly alone by himself accomplished all things that are needful for the salvation of mankind.

1. Christ Jesus the eternal Son of God.
  > *John 1:14*  
  > And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw the glory thereof, as the glory of the only begotten (Son) of the Father, full of grace and truth.
2. Being made man.
  > *Hebrews 2:16*  
  > For he in no sort took the Angels, but he took the seed of Abraham.
3. By his death upon the Cross.
  > *Isaiah 53:5*  
  > But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was broken for our iniquities, the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed.
4. And by his righteousness.
  > *Romans 5:19*  
  > For as by one man's disobedience, many were made sinners: so by the obedience of one, shall many also be made righteous.  
  > *2 Corinthians 5:21*  
  > For he hath made him to be sin for us, which knew no sin, that we should be made the righteousness of God in him.
5. Hath perfectly.
  > *Hebrews 7:25*  
  > Wherefore he is able also perfectly to save them that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.
6. Alone by himself.
  > *Acts 4:12*  
  > Neither is their salvation in any other: for among men there is given none other name under heaven, whereby we must be saved.
7. Accomplished all things needful for the salvation of mankind.
  > *1 John 2:2*  
  > And he is the reconciliation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.
