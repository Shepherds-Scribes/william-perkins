# The Second Principle.

**Q.** What dost thou believe concerning man, and concerning thine own self?  
**A.** All men are wholly corrupted with sin through Adam's fall, and so are become slaves of Satan, and guilty of eternal damnation.

1. All men are corrupted with sin.
  > *Romans 3:10*  
  > As it is written, There is none righteous, no not one.
2. They are wholly corrupted.
  > *1 Thessalonians 5:23*  
  > Now the very God of peace sanctify you throughout, & I pray God that your whole spirit, and soul, and body, may be kept blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.  
  > *Ephesians 4:17-18*  
  > This I say therefore and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in vanity of their mind. Having their cogitation darkened, & being strangers from the life of God, through ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart.  
  > *Genesis 6:5*  
  > When the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and all the imaginations of the thoughts of his heart were evil only continually.
3. Through Adam's fall.
  > *Romans 5:12*  
  > Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death went over all men, for so much as all men have sinned.
4. And so are become slaves of Satan.
  > *Ephesians 2:2*  
  > Wherein in times past ye walked according to the course of the world, and after the Prince that ruleth in the air, even the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience.  
  > *Hebrews 2:14*  
  > For as much then, as the children were partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part with them, that he might destroy through death, him that had the power of death; that is, the devil.  
  > *2 Corinthians 4:4*  
  > In whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds, that is, of Infidels, that the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, which is the image of God, should not shine unto them.
5. And guilty of eternal damnation.
  > *Galatians 3:10*  
  > For as many as are of the works of the law, are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every man that continueth not in all things, which are written in the books of the law, to do them.  
  > *Romans 5:18*  
  > Likewise then, as by the offence of one, the fault came on all men to condemnation: so by the justifying of one, the benefit abounded reward all men, to the justification of life.
