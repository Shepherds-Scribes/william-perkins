# The fifth Principle expounded.

*Q.* What outward meanes muſt wee vſe to obtaine faith, and all the bleſsings of God which come by faith?  
*A.* The *preaching* [^a] of Gods word, and the adminiſtration of the *Sacraments,* and prayer.

*Q.* Where is the word of God to bee found?  
*A.* The whole word of God, needfull to ſaluation, is ſet down in the holy Scriptures.

*Q.* How know you that the Scriptures are the word of God, and not mens policies?  
*A.* I am aſſured of it: firſt [^b] becauſe the holy Ghoſt perſwadeth my conſcience that it is ſo. Secondly, I ſee it by experience: for the preaching of the [^c] Scriptures haue the power of God in them to *humble a man,* when they are preached, and to caſt him downe to hell, and afterward to *reſtore* and raiſe him vp againe.

*Q.* What is the vſe of the word of God preached?  
*A.* Firſt, it [^d] *breedeth*, and then it increaſeth faith in them which are choſen to ſaluation: but vnto them that periſh, it is by reaſon of their corruption, *an occaſion* of their further damnation.

*Q.* How muſt we heare Gods word, that it may be effectuall to our ſaluation?  
*A.* We [^e] muſt come vnto it with hunger-bitten hearts, hauing an appetite to the word; we muſt marke it with attention, receiue it by faith, ſubmit our ſelues vnto it with feare and trembling, euen then when our faults are reprooued: Laſtly, we muſt hide it in the corners of our hearts, that we may frame our liues and conuerſations by it.

*Q.* What is a Sacrament?  
*A.* A [^f] *ſigne* to repreſent, a *ſeale* to confirme, an *inſtrument* to conuey Chriſt and all his benefits to them that do beleeue in him.

*Q.* Why muſt a Sacrament repreſent the mercies of God before our eyes?  
*A.* Becauſe we are dull to conceiue and to remember them.

*Q.* Why do the Sacraments ſeale vnto vs the mercies of God?  
*A.* Because we are full of vnbeleefe, and doubting of them.

*Q.* Why is the Sacrament the inſtrument of the ſpirit to conuey the mercies of God into our hearts?  
*A.* Becauſe wee are like *Thomas,* wee will not beleeue till we feele them in ſome meaſure in our hearts.

*Q.* How many Sacraments are there?  
*A.* Two [^g] and no more: *Baptiſme,* by which we haue our *admiſſion* into the true Church of God, and the *Lords Supper,* by which we are nouriſhed and *preſerued* in the true Church after our admiſsion.

*Q.* What is done in Baptiſme?  
*A.* [^h] In the aſſembly of the Church the *couenant of grace* betweene God and the party baptized, is ſolemnely confirmed and ſealed.

*Q.* In this couenant, what doth God promiſe to the party baptized?  
*A.* [^i] Chriſt, with all bleſsings that come by him.

*Q.* To what condition is the party baptized bound?  
*A.* To [^k] receiue Christ, & to repent his ſin.

*Q.* What meaneth the *sprinkling* or *dipping in water?*  
*A.* It [^l] ſeales vnto vs remiſsion of ſins, and ſanctification by the obedience and ſprinkling of the blood of Chriſt.

*Q.* How commeth it to paſſe, that many after their baptiſme for a long time feele not the effect and fruite of it, and ſome neuer?  
*A.* The fault is not in God, who keepes his couenants, but the fault is in themſelues, in that they doe not keepe the condition of the couenant, to receiue Chriſt by faith, and to repent of all their ſinnes.

*Q.* When ſhall a man then ſee the effect of his baptiſme?  
*A.* At [^m] what time ſoeuer hee doth receiue Chriſt by faith, though it bee many yeares after, he ſhall then feele the power of God to regenerate him, and to worke all things in him, which he offered in baptiſme?

*Q.* How if a man neuer keepe the condition to which he bound himſelfe in baptiſme?  
*A.* His damnation [^n] ſhall bee the greater, becauſe he breaketh his vow made to God.

*Q.* What is done in the Lords Supper?  
*A.* The former couenant ſolemnly ratified in baptiſme, is renued [^o] in the Lords Supper, betweene the Lord himſelfe, & the receiuer?

*Q.* Who is the receiuer?  
*A.* Euery one [^p] that hath beene baptized, and after his baptiſme hath truly beleeued in Chriſt, and repented of his ſinnes from his heart.

*Q.* What meaneth the bread and wine, the eating of the bread and drinking of the wine?  
*A.* Theſe outward actions [^r] are a ſecond ſeale, ſet by the Lords own hand vnto his couenant. And they doe giue euery receiuer to vnderſtand, that as God doth bleſſe the bread and wine, to preſerue & ſtrengthen the body of the receiuer: ſo Chriſt apprehended and receiued by faith, ſhall nouriſh him, and preſerue both body and ſoule vnto eternall life.

*Q.* What ſhall a true receiuer feele in himſelfe after the receiuing of the Sacrament?  
*A.* [^s] The increaſe of his faith in Chriſt, the increaſe of ſanctification, a greater meaſure of dying to ſin, a greater care to liue in newneſſe of life.

*Q.* What if a man after the receiuing of the ſacramét, neuer find any ſuch thing in himſelf?  
*A.* He may well ſuſpect himſelfe whether he did euer repent or not: and therupon is to vſe means to come to ſound faith & repentance.

*Q.* What is another meanes of increaſing faith?  
*A.* Prayer.

*Q.* What is prayer?  
*A.* [^t] A familiar ſpeech with God in the name of Chriſt, [^u] in which either we craue things needfull, or giue thankes for things receiued.

*Q.* In asking things needful, what is required?  
*A.* Two things, an earneſt deſire, and faith.

*Q.* [^v] What things muſt a Chriſtian mans heart deſire?  
*A.* Sixe things eſpecially.

*Q.* What are they?  
*A.* 1. [^w] That he may glorifie God. 2. That [^x] God may reigne in his heart, and not ſinne: 3. That [^y] he may doe Gods will, and not the luſts of his fleſh: 4. [^z] That he may relie himſelfe on Gods prouidence for all the meanes of this temporall life: 5. [^aa] That he may be iuſtified, and be at peace with God: 6. [^ab] That by the power of God hee may bee ſtrengthened againſt all temptations.

*Q.* What is faith?  
*A.* A [^ac] perſwaſion, that thoſe things which we truly deſire, God will grant them for Chriſts ſake.
