# The fourth Principle.

*Q.* But how maiſt thou be made partaker of Chriſt and his benefits.  
*Answ.* A man of a contrite and humble ſpirit, by faith alone apprehending and applying Chriſt with all his merits vnto himſelfe, is iuſtified before God and ſanctified.

1. A man of a contrite and humble ſpirit.
  > Eſa. 57. 15. For thus ſaith hee that is high and excellent; Hee that inhabiteth the eternitie, whoſe name is the Holy one, I dwell in the high and holy place, with him alſo that is of a contrite and humble ſpirit; to reuiue the ſpirit of the humble, and to giue life to them that are of a contrite heart.  
  > Pſal. 51. 17. The ſacrifices of God, are a contrite ſpirit, a contrite and a broken heart, O God, thou wilt not deſpiſe.
2. By faith alone.
  > Mark. 5. 36. As ſoone as Ieſus heard that word ſpoken, hee ſaid vnto the ruler of the Synagogue, Bee not afraid, onely beleeue.  
  > Num. 21. 19. [^1] So Moſes made a ſerpent of braſſe, and ſet it vp for a ſigne, and when a ſerpent had bitten a man, then he looked to the Serpent of braſſe, and liued.  
  > Ioh. 3. 14. And as Moſes lift vp the Serpent in the wilderneſſe, ſo muſt the Sonne of man bee lifted vp.  
  > Verſe 5. [^2] That whoſoeuer beleeueth in him, ſhould not periſh, but haue eternall life.
3. Apprehending and applying Chriſt with all his merits vnto himſelfe.
  > Ioh. 1. 12. But as many as receiued him, to them he gaue power to be the ſonnes of God, to them that beleeue in his name.  
  > Ioh. 6. 35. And Ieſus ſaid vnto them; I am the bread of life, hee that commeth to me, ſhall not hunger, and hee that beleeueth in mee, ſhall neuer thirſt.
4. Is iuſtified before God.
  > Rom. 4. 3 For what ſaith the Scripture; Abraham beleeued God, and it was counted to him for righteouſneſſe.  
  > Verſ. 6. Euen as Dauid declareth the bleſſedneſſe of the man, vnto whom God imputeth rightouſneſſe, without workes: ſaying,  
  > Verſ. 7. Bleſſed are they whoſe iniquities are forgiuen, and whoſe ſinnes are couered.
5. And ſanctified.
  > Acts. 15. 19. [^3] And hee put no difference betweene vs and them, after that by faith hee had purified their hearts.  
  > 1 Cor. 1. 30. But yee are of him in Chriſt Ieſus, who of God is made vnto vs wiſedome, and righteouſneſſe, and ſanctification, and redemption.
