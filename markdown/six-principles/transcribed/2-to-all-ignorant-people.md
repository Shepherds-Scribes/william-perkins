# TO ALL IGNORANT PEOPLE that deſire to be inſtructed.

POORE people, your manner is to ſooth vp your ſelues, as though ye were in a moſt happie eſtate: but if the matter come to a iuſt triall, it will fall out farre otherwiſe. For you leade your liues in great ignorance, as may appeare by theſe your common opinions which follow;

1. That faith is a mans good meaning, and his good ſeruing of God.
2. That God is ſerued by the rehearſing of the ten commandements, the Lords Prayer, and the Creede.
3. That ye haue beleeued in Chriſt euer ſince you could remember.
4. That it is pitie that he ſhould liue which doth any whit doubt of his ſaluation.
5. That none can tell whether he ſhall be ſaued or no certenly: but that all men muſt be of a good beliefe.
6. That howſoeuer a man liue, yet if he call vpon God on his death-bed, and ſay, *Lord haue mercy vpon me,* and ſo goe away like a lambe, he is certainely ſaued.
7. That if any be ſtrangely viſited, he is either taken with a planet, or bewitched.
8. That a man may lawfully ſweare, when he ſpeakes nothing but the truth, and ſweares by nothing but that which is good, as by his faith, or troth.
9. That a preacher is a good man no longer then he is in the pulpit. *They thinke all like themſelues.*
10. That a man may repent when he will, becauſe the Scripture ſaith; *At what time ſoeuer a ſinner doth repent him of his ſinnes, &c.*
11. That it is an eaſier thing to pleaſe God, then to pleaſe our neighbour.
12. That ye can keepe the commandements, as well as God will giue you leaue.
13. That it is the ſafeſt to doe in Religion as moſt doe.
14. That merry ballads and bookes, as *Scoggin,* *Beuis of Southhampton,* *&c.* are good to driue away the time, and to remooue heart-qualmes.
15. That ye can ſerue God with all your hearts, and that ye would be ſorrie elſe.
16. That a man neede not heare ſo many Sermons, except he could follow them better.
17. That a man which commeth at no Sermons, may as well beleeue, as hee which heares all the Sermons in the world.
18. That ye know all the Preacher can tell you. For hee can ſay nothing, but that euery man is a ſinner, that we muſt loue our neighbours as our ſelues, that euery man muſt bee ſaued by Chriſt: and all this ye can tell as well as he.
19. That it was a good world, then the old Religion was, becauſe all things were cheape.
20. That drinking and bezeling in the ale-houſe or tauerne, is good fellowſhip, and ſhewes a good kinde nature, and maintaines neighbourhood.
21. That a man may ſweare by the Maſſe, becauſe it is nothing now, and byr Lady, becauſe ſhee is gone out of the Countrey.
22. That euery man muſt be for himſelfe, and God for vs all.
23. That a man may make of his owne whatſoeuer he can.
24. That if a man remember to ſay his prayers euery morning (though hee neuer vnderſtand them) he hath bleſſed himſelfe for all the day following.
25. That a man prayeth when he ſaith the ten commandements.
26. That a man eates his Maker in the Sacrament.
27. That if a man be no adulterer, no thiefe, no murtherer, and doe no man harme, hee is a right honeſt man.
28. That a man neede not haue any knowledge of religion, becauſe he is not booke-learned.
29. That one may haue a good meaning, when he ſaith and doth that which is euill.
30. That a man may goe to wizzards, called wiſe men, for counſell: becauſe God hath prouided a ſalue for euery ſore.
31. That ye are to be excuſed in all your doings, becauſe the beſt men are ſinners.
32. That ye haue ſo ſtrong a faith in Chriſt, that no euill company can hurt you.

Thoſe and ſuch like ſayings, what argue they but your groſſe ignorance? Now where ignorance raigneth, there raignes ſinne: and where ſinne raignes, there the diuell rules: and where he rules, men are in a damnable caſe.

Ye will reply unto mee thus: that ye are not ſo bad as I would make you. If need be you can ſay the Creede, the Lords prayer, and the ten Commandements: and therefore ye will be of Gods reliefe, ſay all men what they will, and you defie the diuell from your hearts.

I anſwer againe, that it is not ſufficient to ſay all theſe without booke, vnleſſe ye can vnderſtand the meaning of the words, and be able to make a right vſe of the Commandements, of the Creed, of the Lords prayer by applying them inwardly to your hearts and conſciences, and outwardly to your liues and conuerſations. This is the very point in which ye faile.

And for an helpe in this your ignorance, to bring you to true knowledge, vnfained faith, and ſound repentance: here I haue ſet downe the principall points of Chriſtian religion in ſixe plaine and eaſie rules: euen ſuch as the ſimpleſt may eaſily learne: and hereunto is adioyned and expoſition of them word by word. If ye doe want other good directions, then vſe this my labour for your inſtruction. In reading of it, firſt learne the ſixe Principles: and when you haue them without booke, and the meaning of them withall, then learne the expoſition alſo: which being well conceiued, and in ſome meaſure felt in the heart, ye ſhall be able to profit by Sermons, whereas now ye cannot, and the ordinary parts of the Catechiſme, namely the ten Commandements, the Creede, the Lords prayer, and the inſtitution of the two Sacraments, ſhall more eaſily be vnderſtood.

Thine in Chriſt Ieſus,

WILLIAM PERKINS.
