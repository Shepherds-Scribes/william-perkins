# The third principle expounded.

*Q.* If damnation bee the reward of ſinne: then is a man of all creatures moſt miſerable: a dogge or a toade when they die, al their miſerie is ended; but when a man dyeth, there is the beginning of his woe.
*A.* It were ſo indeed, if there were no means of deliuerance, but GOD hath ſhewed his mercy, in giuing a *Sauiour* to mankind.

*Q.* How is this Sauiour called?
*A.* [^a] Ieſus Chriſt.

*Q.* What is Ieſus Chriſt?
*A.* [^b] The eternall Sonne of God made man in all things, euen [^c] in his *infirmities* like other men, ſaue onely in ſinne.

*Q.* How was he made man void of ſinne?
*A.* He was [^d] conceiued in the wombe of a Virgin, and *ſanctified* by the holy Ghoſt at his conception.

*Q.* Why muſt our Sauiour bee both God and man?
*A.* He [^e] muſt bee a man, becauſe man had ſinned, and therefore a man muſt die for ſinne, to appeaſe Gods wrath: he muſt be God, to ſuſtaine & vphold the manhood, to ouercome and vanquiſh death.

*Q.* What be the offices of Chriſt to make him an al-ſufficient Sauiour?
*A.* [^f] He is a Prieſt, a Prophet, a King.

*Q.* Why is he a Prieſt?
*A.* To *worke* the meanes of ſaluation in the behalfe of mankinde.

*Q.* How doth hee worke the meanes of ſaluation?
*A.* [^g] Firſt, by making *ſatisfaction* to his Father for the ſinne of man: ſecondly by making *interceſſion.*

*Q.* How doth he make ſatisfaction?
*A.* By two meanes: and the firſt is by offering a *ſacrifice.*

*Q.* What is the ſacrifice?
*A.* [^h] Chriſt himſelfe, as hee is a man conſiſting of body and ſoule.

*Q.* What is the [^i] Altar.
*A.* Chriſt as hee is God, is the *Altar* on which he ſacrificed himſelfe.

*Q.* Who was the Prieſt?
*A.* None but [^k] Chriſt, and that as he is both God and man.

*Q.* How oft did he ſacrifice himſelfe?
*A.* Neuer but [^l] once.

*Q.* What death did he ſuffer when he ſacrificed himſelfe?
*A.* A death vpon the croſſe, peculiar to himſelf alone: for [^m] beſides the ſeparation of body and ſoule, he felt alſo the *pangs of hell,* in that the whole wrath of God due to the ſinne of man, was powred forth vpon him.

*Q.* What profite commeth by his Sacrifice?
*A.* [^n] Gods wrath is appeaſed by it.

*Q.* Could the ſufferings of Chriſt, which was but for a ſhort time, counteruaile euerlaſting damnation, and ſo appeaſe Gods wrath?
*A.* Yea; for ſeeing Chriſt ſuffered, [^o] God ſuffered, though not in his Godhead: and that is more then if all men in the world had ſuffered for euer and euer.

*Q.* Now tell me the other meanes of *ſatisfaction.*
*A.* It is the perfect fulfilling of *the law.*

*Q.* How did he fulfill the law?
*A.* By [^p] his *perfect righteouſnes:* which conſiſteth of two parts; the firſt, the *integritie and purenes* of his humane nature: the other, [^q] his *obedience* in performing all that the law required.

*Q.* You haue ſhewed how Chriſt doth make *ſatisfaction,* tell me likewiſe how he doth make *interceſſion?*
*A.* He alone doth continually [^r] appeare before his father in heauen, making the faithfull, and all their praiers acceptable vnto him, by applying of the merits of his owne perfect *ſatisfaction* to them.

*Q.* Why is Chriſt a Prophet?
*A.* To [^s] *reueale* vnto his Church the way and meanes of ſaluation, and this he doth outwardly by the miniſterie of his word, and inwardly by the teaching of his ſpirit.

*Q.* Why is he alſo a *King?*
*A.* That [^t] he might *bountifully beſtow* vp on vs, & *conuey* vnto vs al the aforeſaid meanes of ſaluation.

*Q.* How doth he ſhew himſelfe to be King?
*A.* In [^u] that beeing *dead* and *buried,* hee *roſe from the graue,* quickened his dead bodie, *aſcended* into heauen, and now *ſitteth at the right hand* of his Father, with full power and glorie in heauen.

*Q.* How elſe?
*A.* In [^v] that hee doth continually inſpire and direct his ſeruants, by the diuine power of his holy ſpirit, according to his holy word.

*Q.* But to whom will this bleſſed King communicate all theſe meanes of ſaluation?
*A.* He [^w] offereth them to many, and they are *ſufficient* to ſaue all mankinde; but all ſhall not bee ſaued thereby, becauſe by faith they will not receiue them.
