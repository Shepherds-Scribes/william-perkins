# The ſixth Principle.

*Q.* What is the eſtate of all men after death?
*A.* All men ſhall riſe againe with their owne bodies, to the laſt iudgement, which beeing ended, the godly ſhall poſſeſſe the kingdome of heauen: but vnbeleeuers and rebrobates ſhall bee in hell, tormented with the diuell and his angels for euer.

1. All men ſhall riſe againe with their owne bodies.
  > Ioh 5. 28. Maruell not at this, for the houre ſhall come, in the which all that are in the graues ſhall heare his voice.
  > Verſe. 29. And they ſhall come forth that haue done good, vnto the reſurrection of life: but they that haue done euill, vnto the reſurrection of condemnation.
2. To the laſt iudgement.
  > Eccl. 12. 14. For God will bring euery worke vnto iudgement, with euery ſecret thing, whether it bee good or euill.
  > Mat. 12. 36. But I ſay vnto you, that of euery idle word that men ſhall ſpeake, they ſhall giue an account thereof, at the day of iudgement.
3. Which beeing ended the godly.
  > 2 Pet. 2. 7. And deliuered iuſt Lot, vexed with the vncleane conuerſation of the wicked.
  > Ezech. 9. 4. And the Lord ſaid vnto him: goe through the middeſt of the Citie, euen through the middeſt of Ieruſalem, & ſet a marke vpon the forehead of them that mourne, and crie for all the abbominations that bee done in the middeſt thereof.
4. Shall poſſeſſe the kingdome of God.
  > Mat. 25. 34. Then ſhall the king ſay to them on his right hand, Come yee bleſſed of my Father, inherit yee the kingdome prepared for you from the beginning of the world.
5. But vnbeleeuers and rebrobates ſhall bee in hell, tormented with the diuell and his angels.
  > Verſe. 41. Then ſhall hee ſay vnto them on the left hand, Depart from mee yee cursed into euerlaſting fire, which is prepared for the diuell & his angels.

The Scriptures for proofe were onely quoted by the Author, to mooue thee to ſearch them: the words themſelues I haue expreſſed at the earneſt requeſt of many, that thou maieſt more eaſily learne them: if yet thou wilt bee ignorant, thy malice is euident; if thou gaineſt knowledg, giue God the glorie in doing of his will. *Thine* T.S.
