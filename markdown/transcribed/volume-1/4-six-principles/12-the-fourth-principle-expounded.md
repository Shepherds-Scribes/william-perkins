# The fourth principle expounded.

*Q.* What is faith?
*A.* Faith is a [^a] wonderfull grace of God, by which a man doth apprehend and applie Chriſt, and all his benefits vnto himſelfe.

*Q.* How doth a man apply Chriſt vnto himſelfe, ſeeing wee are on earth, and Chriſt in heauen?
*A.* This [^b] applying is done by *aſſurance,* when a man is verily perſwaded by the holy ſpirit, of Gods fauour towards himſelfe *particularly,* & of the forgiuenes of his *owne* ſinnes.

*Q.* How doth God bring men truly to beleeue in Chriſt?
*A.* Firſt, hee prepareth their hearts, that they might be capable of faith: and then hee worketh faith in them.

*Q.* How doth God prepare mens hearts?
*A.* [^c] By bruiſing them, as if one would breake an hard ſtone to powder: and this is done by *humbling* them.

*Q.* How doth God humble a man?
*A.* By working in him a ſight of his ſins, and a ſorrow for them.

*Q.* How is this ſight of ſinne wrought?
*A.* By the [^d] morall law: the ſumme whereof is the ten commandements.

*Q.* What ſinnes may I finde in my ſelfe by them?
*A.* Tenne.

*Q.* What is the firſt?
*A.* [^e] To make ſomething thy God, which is not God, by fearing it, louing it, and ſo truſting in it more then in the true God.

*Q.* What is the ſecond?
*A.* [^f] To worſhip falſe gods, or the true God in a falſe manner.

*Q.* What is the third?
*A.* [^g] To diſhonour God in abuſing his titles, words, and workes.

*Q.* What is the fourth?
*A.* To [^h] breake the Sabbath, in doing the works of their calling, & of the fleſh; and in leauing vndone the workes of the ſpirit.

*Q.* What be the ſixe latter?
*A.* To doe any thing that may hinder thy neighbours [^i] dignity, [^k] life, [^l] chaſtity, [^m] wealth, [^n] good name, [^o] though it be but in the ſecret thoughts and motions of the heart vnto which thou giueſt no liking nor conſent.

*Q.* What is ſorrow for ſinne?
*A.* It is [^p] when a mans conſcience is touched with a liuely feeling of Gods diſpleaſure for any of theſe ſinnes: [^q] in ſuch wiſe, that hee vtterly deſpaires of ſaluation, in regard of an ything in himſelfe, acknowledging that he hath deſerued ſhame and confuſion eternally.

*Q.* How doth God worke this ſorrow?
*A.* By the terrible curſe of the law.

*Q.* What is that?
*A.* Hee [^r] which breakes but one of the commandements of God, though it be but once in all his lifetime, and that onely in one thought, is ſubiect to, and in danger of eternall damnation thereby.

*Q.* When mens hearts are thus prepared, how doth God ingraft faith in them?
*A.* By working certaine inward motions in the heart, which are the ſeedes of faith, out of which it breedeth.

*Q.* What is the firſt of them?
*A.* When a man humbled vnder the burden of his ſinnes, doth [^ſ] acknowledge and feele that he ſtands in great neede of Chriſt.

*Q.* What is the ſecond?
*A.* An [^t] hungring deſire & a longing to be made partaker of Chriſt & all his merits.

*Q.* What is the third?
*A.* A [^u] flying to the throne of grace, from the ſentence of the law pricking the conſcience.

*Q.* How is it done?
*A.* By [^x] praying, with ſending vp loud cries for Gods fauour in Chriſt, in the pardoning of ſinne; and with feruent perſeuerance herein, till the deſire of the heart be granted.

*Q.* What followeth after this?
*A.* God then [^y] according to his mercifull promiſe, lets the poore ſinner feele the aſſurrance of his loue wherewith he loueth him in Chriſt, which aſſurance is a liuely faith.

*Q.* Are there diuers degrees and meaſures of true faith?
*A.* [^z] Yea.

*Q.* What is the leaſt meaſure of true faith that any man can haue?
*A.* When a man of an humble ſpirit, by reaſon of the [^aa] littleneſſe of his faith, doth not yet *feele* the aſſurance of the forgiueneſſe of his ſinnes, and yet he is perſwaded that they are pardonable; and therefore deſireth that they ſhould be pardoned, and with his heart praieth to God to pardon them.

*Q.* How doe you know that ſuch a man hath faith?
*A.* Theſe [^ab] *deſires* and *praiers* are teſtimonies of the Spirit, whoſe propertie it is to ſtirre vp a *longing* and a *luſting* after heauenly things with *ſighes* and *groanes* for Gods fauour and mercie in Chriſt. [^ac] Now where the Spirit of Chriſt is, there is Chriſt dwelling; and where Chriſt dwelleth, there is true faith, how weake ſoeuer it be.

*Q.* What is the greateſt meaſure of faith?
*A.* When a man daily increaſing in faith comes to be [^ad] *fully perſwaded* of Gods loue in Chriſt towards himſelfe *particularly*, and of the foriueneſſe of his owne ſinnes.

*Q.* When ſhall a Chriſtian heart come to this full aſſurance?
*A.* Not [^ae] at the firſt, but in ſome continuance of time, when he hath beene well practiſed *in repentance;* and hath had diuers *experiences* of Gods loue vnto him in Chriſt: then after them will appeare in his heart the fulnes of perſwaſion: which is the *ripeneſſe* [^af] and ſtrength of faith.

*Q.* What benefits doth a man receiue by faith in Chriſt?
*A.* Hereby [^ag] hee is *iuſtified* before God, and ſanctified.

*Q.* What is this, to be *iuſtified* before God?
*A.* It [^ah] comprehendeth two things: the firſt, to be cleared from the *guiltineſſe and puniſhment* of ſinne; the ſecond, to be accepted as perfectly righteous before God.

*Q.* How is a man cleared from the guiltineſſe and puniſhment of his ſinnes?
*A.* By Chriſts [^ai] ſufferings and death vpon the croſſe.

*Q.* How is he accepted for righteous before God?
*A.* By the [^ak] righteouſneſſe of Chriſt *imputed* to him.

*Q.* What profit cóes by being thus iuſtified?
*A.* Hereby [^al] and by no other meanes in the world, the beleeuer ſhall bee *accepted* before Gods iudgement ſeate, as *worthy* of eternall life by the *merits* of the ſame righteouſneſſe of Chriſt.

*Q.* Doe not good workes then make vs *worthy* of eternall life?
*A.* No: For God, who is perfect righteouſnes it ſelfe, will find in the beſt workes we doe, more matter of damnation then of ſaluation: and therefore [^am] we muſt rather condemne our ſelues for our good workes, then looke to be iuſtified before God thereby.

*Q.* How may a man know that he is iuſtified before God?
*A.* Hee neede not aſcend into heauen to ſearch the ſecret councell of God: [^an] but rather deſcend into his owne heart to ſearch whether *he be ſanctified* or not.

*Q.* What is it to be ſanctified?
*A.* It comprehendeth two things: the firſt, to be purged from the corruption of his own nature, the ſecond, to be indued with inward righteouſneſſe.

*Q.* How is the *corruption* of ſinne purged?
*A.* By the [^ao] *merits* and *power* of Chriſts death, which being by faith applyed is as a *coraſiue* to abate, conſume, and weaken the power of all ſinne.

*Q.* How is a man indued with inherent righteouſneſſe?
*A.* Through the [^ap] vertue of Chriſts reſurrection: which being applyed by faith, is as a *reſtoratiue* to reuiue a man that is dead in ſinne, to newneſſe of life.

*Q.* In what part of man is ſanctification wrought?
*A.* In [^aq] euery part of body and ſoule.

*Q.* In what time is it wrought?
*A.* It is [^ar] begun in this life, in which the faithfull receiue onely the *firſt fruits* of the Spirit, and it is not finiſhed before the end of this life.

*Q.* What graces of the Spirit doe vſually ſhew themſelues in the heart of a man ſanctified?
*A.* The *hatred* [^as] of sinne, and the loue of righteouſneſſe.

*Q.* What proceedes of them?
*A.* *Repentance,* which is [^at] a ſetled purpoſe in the heart, with a careful endeauour to leaue all his ſinnes, and to liue a Chriſtian life, according to all Gods commandements.

*Q.* What goeth with repentance?
*A.* A continuall fighting and ſtrugling againſt the aſſaults of a mans owne fleſh, againſt the motions of the diuell, and the inticements of the world.

*Q.* What followeth after a man hath gotten the victory in any temptation or affliction?
*A.* [^au] Experience of Gods loue in Chriſt, and ſo increaſe of peace of conſcience, and ioy in the holy Ghoſt.

*Q.* What followeth if in any temptation he be ouercome and through infirmity fall?
*A.* After a while [^ax] there will ariſe a *godly sorrow,* which is, when a man is grieued for no other cauſe in the world, but for this onely, that by his ſin he hath diſpleaſed God, who hath been vnto him a moſt mercifull and louing Father.

*Q.* What ſigne is there of this ſorrow?
*A.* The true ſigne [^ay] of it is this, when a man can bee grieued for the very *diſobedience of God* in his euill word or deede, though he ſhould neuer be puniſhed, and though there were neither heauen nor hell.

*Q.* What followes after this ſorrow?
*A.* Repentance [^az] *renewed afreſh.*

*Q.* By what ſignes will this repentance appeare?
*A.* By [^ba] ſeuen. 1. A care to leaue the ſinne into which hee is fallen. 2. An vtter condemning of himſelfe for it, with a crauing of pardon. 3. A great anger againſt himſelfe for his careleſneſſe. 4. A feare leſt he ſhould fall into the ſame ſinne againe. 5. A deſire euer after to pleaſe God. 6. A zeale of the ſame. 7. Reuenge vpon himſelfe for his former offence.
