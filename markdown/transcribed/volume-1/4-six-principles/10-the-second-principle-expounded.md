# The ſecond Principle expounded.

*Q.* Let vs now come to our ſelues, and firſt tell me what is the naturall eſtate of man?
*A.* Euery man is by nature [^a] *dead* in ſin as a loathſome carrió, or as a dead corps lieth rotting and ſtinking in the graue, hauing in him the ſeed of all ſinnes.

*Q.* What is ſinne?
*A.* Any [^b] breach of the of [sic] law of God, if it bee no more but the leaſt want of that which the law requireth.

*Q.* How many ſorts of ſinne are there?
*A.* Sinne is either the [^c] corruption of nature, or any euill actions that proceed of it, as fruits thereof.

*Q.* In whom is the corruption of nature?
*A.* In all men [^d] none excepted.

*Q.* In what part of man is it?
*A.* In euery [^e] part both of body and ſoule, like as a leproſie that runneth from the crowne of the head to the ſoale of the foote.

*Q.* Shew me how euery part of man is corrupted with ſinne?
*A.* Firſt, in the [^f] minde there is nothing but ignorance and blindnes concerning heauenly matters. Secondly, [^g] the conſcience is defiled, being alwaies either benumbed with ſinne, or elſe turmoyled with inward accuſations and terrors. Thirdly, [^h] the will of man onely willeth and luſteth after euill. Fourthly, the [^i] affections of the heart, as loue, ioy, hope, deſire, &c. are mooued and ſtirred to that which is euill to embrace it, and they are neuer ſtirred vnto that which is good, vnleſſe it bee to eſchew it. Laſtly, the [^k] members of the body are the inſtruments & tooles of the minde for the execution of ſinne.

*Q.* what bee thoſe euill actions that are the fruits of this corruption?
*A.* [^l] Euill thoughts in the minde, which come either by a mans owne conceiuing, or by the ſuggeſtion of the diuell: [^m] euill motions and luſts ſtirring in the heart, and from theſe ariſe euill words and deeds, when any occaſion is giuen.

*Q.* How commeth it to paſſe that all men are thus defiled with ſinne?
*A.* By [^n] *Adam* infidelity and diſobedience, in eating the forbidden fruit: euen as we ſee great perſonages by treaſon do not onely hurt themſelues, but alſo ſtaine their blood, and diſgrace their poſterity.

*Q.* What hurt comes to man by his ſin?
*A.* [^o] He is continually ſubiect to the curſe of God in his life time, in the end of his life, and after this life.

*Q.* What is the curſe of God in this life?
*A.* [^p] In the bodie diſeaſes, aches, paines: in the ſoule, blindnes, hardnes of heart, horror of conſcience, in goods, hinderances, and loſſes: in name ignominie and reproch: laſtly, in the whole man, *bondage* vnder Sathan the prince of darkeneſſe.

*Q.* What manner of *bondage is this?*
*A.* This *bondage* [^q] is when a man is the ſlaue of the diuell, and hath him to raigne in his heart as his God.

*Q.* How may a man know whether Sathan be his God or not?
*A.* Hee may know it by this, if hee giue obedience to him in heart, and expreſſe it in his conuerſation.

*Q.* And how ſhall a man perceiue this obedience?
*A.* If he [^r] take delight in the euill motions that Satan puts into his heart, and doe fulfill the luſts of the diuell.

*Q.* What is the curſe due to man in the end of this life:
*A.* [^ſ] Death, which is the ſeparation of bodie and ſoule.

*Q.* What is the curſe after this life?
*A.* [^t] Eternall damnation in hell fire, wherof euery man is guilty, and is in as great danger of it, as the traytor apprehended is in danger of hanging, drawing and quartering.
