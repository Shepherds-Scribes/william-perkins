# Of Christ's Nativity and Office.

Thus much concerning Christ's incarnation, the clear declaration there was by his nativity.

## The Nativity of Christ

The nativity of Christ is that whereby Mary, a virgin, did after the course of nature and the custom of woman bring forth Christ, the Word of the Father and the Son of David: so that those are much deceived, which are of opinion that Christ, after a miraculous manner, came into the world, the womb of the Virgin being shut. 

> Every man child which first openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord.
> Luke 2:23

The which place of Scripture is applied to Mary and our Savior Christ. Hence it is that the Virgin Mary is said (θεοτόκος) [^1] to bring forth God, albeit she is not any way mother of the Godhead. For Christ, as he is God, is without mother; and as man, without Father.

It is convenient to be thought that Mary continued a virgin until her dying day, albeit we make not this opinion any article of our belief.

1. Christ being now to depart the world committed his mother to the tuition and custody of his Disciple John, which it is like he would not have done if she had any children by whom, as custom was, she might have been provided for. (John 19:26) 
2. It is likely that she who was with child by the Holy Ghost would not after know any man.
3. It is agreed of by the Church in all ages.

Christ, being now born, was circumcised the eighth day, that he might fulfill all the righteousness of the law: and being thirty years of age, he was baptized, that he, being publicly and solemnly invested into the office of his mediatorship, might take upon him the guilt of our sins. He was both circumcised and baptized, that we might learn: 

1. That the whole efficacy of the Sacraments depend alone and wholly upon him. 
2. That he was Mediator of mankind, both before and under the law, as also under grace. 
3. That he is the knot and bond of both covenants.

## The Office of Christ

His office followeth, to the perfect accomplishing whereof he was anointed of his Father, that is, he was sufficiently furnished with both gifts and authority. 

> Therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
> Hebrews 1:9

> The spirit of the Lord was upon me, therefore he anointed me.
> Isaiah 61:1

> God giveth him not the spirit of measure.
> John 3:34

## Christ the Mediator

If any man put forth this as a reason that Christ could not perform the office of a mediator, being not the mean or middle betwixt God and man, but the party offended, and so one of the extremes: we must know that Christ is two ways said to be the middle or mean. 

1. Betwixt God and all men: for being both God and man, he doth participate with both extremes. 
2. Betwixt God and the faithful only: First, according to his humanity, whereby he received the spirit without measure. 

Secondly, according to his divine nature, namely, as he is the Word. Now the Word is *middle*, betwixt the Father, and the faithful: 

1. In regard of order, because the Word was begotten of the Father, and by it we have access unto the Father. This subordination, which is of the Son to the Father, is not in the divine essence, severally and distinctly considered, but in the relation or manner of having the essence. And those things which are subordinate after this manner cannot be unequal, if they have one and the same singular essence. 
2. In regard of his office, the which being imposed on him by his Father, he did willingly undergo, and of his own accord.

Christ doth exercise this office according to both natures united in one person, and according to each nature distinct one from the other. For in reconciling God and man together, the flesh performeth some things distinctly, and the Word other things distinctly: Again, some other things are done not by the Word or flesh alone, but by both together.

This office is so appropriate to Christ that neither in whole nor in part can it be translated to any other. 

> This man because he endureth for ever, hath an everlasting priesthood, or a priesthood that cannot pass from one man to another.
> Hebrews 7:24

Therefore Christ, as he is God, hath under him Emperors, Kings, Princes, to be his Viceregents; who therefore are called Gods (Psalm 82:1). But as he is Mediator (that is, a Priest, a Prophet, and King of the Church of God,) he hath no Viceregent, Vicar, or Lieutenant, who in his Kingly, Priestly or Prophetical office, in two of these, or in one, can be in his stead.

## The Threefold Office

Christ's office is threefold: Priestly, Prophetical, and Regal (Psalm 110:1-4, Isaiah 42:1).

### Priesthood

Christ's Priesthood is an office of his, wherein he performed all those things to God whereby are obtained eternal life. 

> And being consecrated, was made the author of eternal salvation, unto all them that obey him: and is called of God an high Priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.
> Hebrews 5:9-10

> This man because he endureth for ever, hath an everlasting priesthood; wherefore he is able also perfectly to save all them that come unto God by him.
> Hebrews 7:24-25

His Priesthood consisteth of two parts: Satisfaction, and Intercession.

Satisfaction is that, whereby Christ is a full propitiation to his Father for the Elect. Iob. 33. 23. *If there be a messenger with him, or an interpreter, one of a thousand, to declare vnto man his righteousnesse, then will he haue mercie vpon him, and will say, Deliuer him that he goe not downe into the pit, for I haue found a reconciliation.* Rom. 3. 24. *And are iustified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Iesus.* vers. 25. *Whom God hath set forth to bee a reconciliation through faith in his blood.* 1. Ioh. 2. 2. *He is a propitiation for our sinnes.*

Christs satisfied Gods anger for mans offence; according to his humanity, by performing perfect obedience to the will of God; according to his Deitie, by ministring to the same perfect obedience, especiall dignity, to wit, merit before God, & efficacy. Ioh. 17. 19. *For their sakes sanctifie I am selfe, that they also may be sanctified through the truth.* Act. 20. 28. *To feede the flocke of God, which hee hath purchased with his owne blood.* 2. Cor. 5. 19. *God was in Christ, and reconciled the world to himselfe, not imputing their sinnes vnto them.*

Satisfaction comprehendeth his passion, and fulfilling the Law.

His passion, is the first part of Satisfaction, by which, he hauing vndergone the punishment of sinne, satisfied Gods iustice, and appeased his anger for the sinnes of the faithfull. His passion was on this manner.

(*a*) Somewhat before his death, partly feare arising from the sense of Gods wrath imminent vpon him, partly griefe possessing, as it were, each part of him, so disturbed his sacred mind, (*b*) that inwardly for a while it stroke into him a strange kind of astonishment, or rather obliuion of his duty imposed vpó him: & outwardly (*c*) made him pray vnto his Father (if he would) to remooue that cup from him, the which he did expresse with no small cry, many teares, & a bloody sweat, (d) trickling from his bodie vnto the ground. But when he came againe vnto himselfe, (*e*) hee freely yeelded himselfe vnto his Father to satisfie vpon the crosse for the transgression of man. After this his agonie was ouerpassed, (*f*) by *Iudas* his treachery Christ is apprehended, and (*g*) first he is brought to *Annas*, after to *Caiphas*, where *Peter* denieth him: (*h*) from *Caiaphas* hee is lead bound to *Pilate*, (*i*) *Pilate* posteth him ouer to *Herod*, (*k*) hee transposteth him backe againe to *Pilate*, (*l*) who acknowledgeth his innocencie, and yet condemneth him as an offendour. This innocent thus condemned, is (*m*) pitifully scourged, crowned with thornes, scoffed, spitted at, spitefully adiudged to the death of the crosse, (*n*) on which his hands and feet are fastened with nailes. Here staied not his passions, but after all these (*o*) he became as accursed to God the Father, that is, God powred vpon him, being thus innocent, such a sea of his wrath, as was equiualent to the sinnes of the whole world. He now being vnder this curse, through the sense and feeling of this strange terrour, (*p*) complaineth to his Father that he is forsaken: who notwithstanding, encountring then with Satan and his angels, did vtterly vanquish (*q*) and ouercome them. When this was ended, his heart (*r*) was pierced with a speare, till the blood gushed out from his sides, and he gaue vp (*s*) the ghost: and (*t*) commended his spirit to his Fathers protection, the which immediatly went into Paradise. His body, (*u*) whereof not one bone was broken, was buried, and three daies was (*x*) ignominiously captiuated of death. (*a*) Mark. 4. 32. Math. 26. 38. (*b*) Ioh. 12. 27. Mark. 14. 35. (*c*) Math. 26. 37. 42. Ioh. 12. 29. Heb. 5. 7. (*d*) Luk. 22. 44. (*e*) Heb. 9. 5. 1. Cor. 5. 7. Esa. 53. 10, 11. (*f*) Math. 26. 47. (*g*) Ioh. 18. 13, 14. (*h*) Ioh. 18. 29. (*i*) Luk. 23. 7, 8. (*k*) Luk. 23. 15. (*l*) Math. 27. 24. 26. (*m*) the same place. (*n*) Ioh. 19. 18. (*o*). Gal. 3. 13. (*p*) Math. 27. 35. 46. (*q*) Col. 1. 14, 15. (*r*) Ioh. 19. 34. (*s*) Heb. 9. 15, 16. (*t*) Luk. 23. 43. 46. (*u*) Ioh. 19. 33. 42. (*x*) Act. 1. 13.

In this description of Christs passion, we may note fiue circumstances especially.

I. His Agony, namely, a vehement anguish, arising vpon the conflict of two contrary desires in him: The first, was to be obedient to his Father. The second, to auoid the horror of death. Luk. 22. 44. *Being in an agonie, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood, trickling downe to the ground.* Heb. 5. 7. *In the daies of his flesh did offer vp prayers and supplications, with strong crying and teares vnto him, that was able to saue him from death, and was also heard in that which he feared.*

II. His Sacrifice, which is an action of Christs offering himselfe to God the Father, as a ransome for the sinnes of the elect. Heb. 9. 26. *Now in the end of the world hath he appeared once to put away sinne, by the sacrifice of himselfe.*

In this sacrifice the oblation was Christ, as he was man. Heb. 10. 10. *By the which will we are sanctified, euen by the offering of Iesus Christ once made.*

The Altar also was Christ, as he was God. Heb. 13. 10. *Wee haue an Altar, whereof they haue no authoritie to eate which serue in the Tabernacle.* Heb. 9. 14. *How much more shall the blood of Christ, which through the eternall spirit offered himselfe without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead workes to serue the liuing God?* Hence it is, that Christ is said to sanctifie himselfe, as he is man, Ioh. 17. 19. *For their sakes, sanctifie I my selfe.* As the Altar, the gift; and the temple, the gold, Matth. 23. 17. 19.

Christ is the Priest, as he is God and man. Heb. 5. 6. *Thou art a Priest for euer after the order of Melchisedec.* 1. Tim. 2. 5, 6. *One Mediatour betweene God and man, the man Christ Iesus, who gaue himselfe a ransome for all men, to be a testimony in due time.*

III. God the fathers acceptation of that his sacrifice, in which he was well pleased. For, had it beene that God had not allowed of it, Christs suffering had beene in vaine, Math. 3. 17. *This is my beloued Sonne, in whom I am well pleased.* Eph. 5. 2. *Euen as Christ loued vs, and gaue himselfe for vs, to be an offering and a sacrifice of a sweete smelling sauour to God.*

IV. Imptutation of mans sinne to Christ, whereby his Father accounted him as a transgressour, hauing translated the burdé of mans sinnes to his shoulders. Esay 53. 4. *He hath borne our infirmities, & carried our sorrowes: yet we did iudge him as plagued and smitten of God, and humbled: but he was wounded for our transgressions, he was broken for our iniquities, & c.* and vers 12. *He was counted with the transgressours, and he bare the sinnes of many.* 2. Cor. 5. 21. *He hath made him to be sinne for vs, which knew no sinne, that we should be made the righteousnesse of God in him.*

V. His wonderfull humiliation consisting of two parts. I. In that he made himselfe of small or no reputatió in respect of his Deity, Phil. 2. 7, 8. *He made himselfe of no reputation, &c. hee humbled himselfe, and became obedient vnto the death, euen the death of the crosse.*

We may not thinke, that this debasing of Christ came, because his diuine nature was either wasted or weakened, but because his Deitie did, as it were, lay aside, and conceale his power and maiestie for a season. And as *Irenaus* saith, *The Word rested, that the humane nature might be crucified and dead.*

II. In that he became execrable, which is, by the Law accursed for vs. Gal. 3. 10. *Cursed is euery one that remaineth not in all things written in the booke of the Law to doe them.*

This accursednesse, is either inward or outward.

Inward, is the sense of Gods fearefull anger vpon the crosse. Reuel. 19. 15. *Hee it is that treadeth the winepresse of the fiercenes & wrath of Almighty God.* Esay 53. 5. *He is grieued for our transgressions, the chastisement of our peace was vpon him, and with his stripes we were healed.* This appeared by those drops of blood, which issued from him, by his cryings to his Father vpon the crosse, and by sending of an Angel to comfort him. Hence was it, that he so much feared death, which many Martyrs entertained most willingly.

His outward accursednes, standeth in three degrees. I. Death vpon the crosse, which was not imaginary, but true, because blood and water issued from his heart. For seeing that water and blood gushed forth together, it is very like, the casket or coat which inuesteth the heart called *Pericardion*, was pierced. As *Columbus* obserueth in his Anatomy, 7. booke. *Ioh.* 19. 34.

His death was necessary, that hee might confirme to vs the Testament, or Couenant of grace promised for our sakes, Heb. 9. 15, 16. *For this cause he is the Mediatour of the new Testament, that through death, &c. they which were called, might receiue the promise of eternall inheritance: for where a Testament is, there must be the death of him that made the Testament, &c.* vers. 17.

II. Buriall, to ratifie the certentie of his death.

III. Descending into hell, which we must not vnderstand, that he went locally into the place of the damned, but that for the time of his abode in the graue, he was vnder the ignominious dominion of death. Act. 2. 24. *Whom God hath raised vp, and loosed the sorrowes of death because it was impossible, that he should bee holden of it.* Eph. 4. 9. *In that he ascended, what was it but that he also descended first into the lowest part of the earth?*

It was necessarie that Christ should bee captiuated of death, that he might abolish the sting, that is the power thereof. 1. Cor. 15. 55. *O death where is thy sting! O hell where is thy victorie!*

Thus we haue heard of Christs marueilous passion, whereby he hath abolished both the first and second death, due vnto vs for our sinnes; the which (as we may further obserue) is a perfect ransome for the sinnes of all and euery one of the elect. 1. Tim. 2. 6. *Who gaue himselfe a ransome for all men.* For it was more, that Christ the only begotten Sonne of God, yea, God himselfe, for a small while should beare the curse of the law, then if the whole world should haue suffered eternall punishment.

This also is worthy our Meditation, that then a man is well grounded in the doctrine of Christs passion, when his heart ceaseth to sinne, and is pricked with the griefe of those sinnes, whereby, as with speares hee pierced the side of the immaculate lambe of God, 1. Ioh. 3. 6. *Who so sinneth, neither hath seene him, nor known him.* Zach. 12. 10. *And they shall looke vpon him, whom they haue pierced, and they shall lament for him, as one lamenteth for his onely sonne, and be sorie for him, as one is sorie for his first borne.*

After Christs passion, followeth the fulfilling of the Law, by which he satisfied Gods iustice in fulfilling the whole Law, Rom. 8. 3, 4. *God sent his owne Sonne, that the righteousnesse of the Law might be fulfilled by vs.*

He fulfilled the Law, partly by the holines of his humane nature, and partly by obedience in the workes of the Law. Rom. 8. 2. *The Law of the spirit of life, which is in Christ Iesus hath freed me from the Law of sinne, and of death.* Math. 3. 15. *It becommeth vs to fulfill all righteousnesse, &c.* Ioh. 17. 19.

Now succeedeth the second part of Christs Priesthood, namely, intercession, whereby Christ is an Aduocate and intreater of God the Father for the faithfull. Rom. 8. 34. *Christ is at the right hand of God, and maketh requst for vs.* Christs intercession, is directed immediately to God the Father. 1. Ioh. 2. 1. *If any man sin, we haue an Aduocate with the Father, euen Iesus Christ the iust.* Now as the Father is the first of the Trinitie in order, so if he be appeased, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost are appeased also. For there is one and the same agreement & will of all the persons of the Trinitie.

Christ maketh intercession according to both natures. First, according to his humanitie, partly by appearing before his Father in heauen, partly by desiring the saluation of the Elect. Heb. 9. 24. *Christ is entred into very heauen to appeare now in the sight of God for vs.* And chap. 7. 25. *He is able perfectly to saue them that come to God by him, seeing he euer liueth to make intercession for them.* Secondly, according to his Deitie, partly by applying the merit of his death; partly by making request by his holy Spirit, in the hearts of the Elect, with sighes vnspeakable, 1. Pet. 1. 2. *Elect according to the foreknowledge of the Father to the sanctification of the spirit.* Rom. 8. 26. *The spirit helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what to pray as we ought, but the spirit it selfe maketh request for vs with sighes which cannot be expressed.*

We are not therefore to imagine of surmise that Christ prostrateth himselfe vpon his knees before his Fathers throne for vs, neither is it necessary, seeing his very presence before his Father, hath in it the force of an humble petition.

The end of Christs intercession is, that such as are iustified by his merits, should by this meanes continue in the state of grace. Now Christs intercession preserueth the elect in couering their continuall slips, infirmities, and imperfect actions, by an especiall and continuall application of his merits; that by this meanes mans person may remaine iust, & mans workes acceptable to God. 1. Ioh. 2. 2. *He is a reconciliation for our sins, & not for ours onely, but for the sinnes of the whole world.* 1. Pet. 2. 5. *Yea as liuely stones, he made a spirituall house & holy priest-hood, to offer vp spirituall sacrifices acceptable to God by Iesus Christ.* Reu. 8. 3, 4. *And another Angell came and stood before the Altar, hauing a golden censer, and much odours was giuen vnto him, that he should offer with the prayers of all Saints vpon the golden altar, which is before the throne, and the smoake of the odours with the prayers of the Saints, went vp before God out of the Angels hand.*

This farre concerning Christs Priesthood; now follow his Propheticall, and Regall offices.

His Propheticall office, is that, whereby he immediately from his Father, reuealeth his word and all the meanes of saluation comprised in the same. Ioh. 1. 18. *The Sonne, which is in the bosome of his Father, he hath declared vnto you.* Ioh. 8. 26. *Those things which I heare of my Father, I speake to the world.* Deut. 18. 18. *I will raise them vp a Prophet, &c.*

The word was first reuealed, partly by visions, by dreames, by speech; partly by the instinct and motion of the holy Ghost. Heb. 1. 1. *At sundry times, and in diuers manners, God spake in old time to our fathers the Prophets: in these last daies he hath spoken to vs by his Son.* 2. Pet. 1. 21. *Prophecie came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of GOD spake as they were mooued by the holy Ghost.*

The like is done ordinarily onely by the preaching of the word, where the holy Ghost doth inwardly illuminate the vnderstanding. Luk. 24. 45. *Then opened he their vnderstanding that they might vnderstand the Scriptures.* & 21. 15. *I will giue you a mouth and wisedome, where against all your aduersaries shall not be able to speake, nor resist.* Act. 16. 14. *Whose heart the Lord opened, that shee attended on the things that Paul spake.* For this cause, Christ is called the Doctor, Lawgiuer, and Counsellour of his Church. Matth. 23. 10. *Be not called Doctours, for one is your Doctour, Iesus Christ.* Iam. 4. 12. *There is one Lawgiuer which is able to saue and to destroy.* Esa. 9. 6. *He shall call his name Counsellour, &c.* Yea, he is the Apostle of our profession. Heb. 3. 1. The Angell of the couenant. Mal. 3. 1. And the Mediatour of the new couenant. Heb. 9. 15. Therefore the Soueraigne authoritie of expounding the Scripture, onely belongs to Christ: and the Church hath onely the ministery of iudgement and interpretation committed vnto her.

Christs Regall office, is that; whereby he distributeth his gifts, and disposeth all things for the benefit of the elect. Psal. 2. & 110. 1, 2. *The Lord said vnto my Lord, sit thou on my right hand till I make thine enemies thy footstoole.*

The execution of Christs Regall office, comprehendeth his exaltation.

Christs exaltation is that, by which he, after his lowest humiliation; was by little and little exalted to glory; and that in sundry respects, according to both his natures.

The exaltation of his diuine nature, is an apparant declaration of his diuine properties in his humane nature, without the least alteration thereof. Rom. 1. 4. *Declared mightily to be the sonne of God, touching the spirit of sanctification by the resurrection from the dead.* Act. 2. 36. *God hath made him both Lord and Christ, whom ye haue crucified.*

The exaltation of his humanity, is the putting off from him his seruile condition and all infirmities, and the putting on of such habituall gifts; which, albeit they are created and finite, yet they haue so great and so marueilous perfection, as possibly can befall any creature. The gifts of his minde, are wisedome, knowledge, ioy, and other vnspeakable vertues: of his body, immortality, strength, agilitie, brightnesse. Phil. 3. 21. *Who shal change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like vnto his glorious body.* Math. 17. 2. *He was transfigured before them, and his face did shine as the Sun, and his cloathes were as white as the light.* Heb. 1, 9. *God euen thy God hath annointed thee with the oyle of gladnesse aboue thy fellowes.* Eph. 1. 20. 22.

Christs body, although, it be thus glorified, yet is it still of a solide substance, compassed about, visible, palpable, and shall perpetually remaine in some certaine place, Luk. 24. 39. *Behold my hands, and my feete, it is euen I, touch me, and see: a spirit hath no flesh and bones, as ye see me haue.*

There be three degrees of Christs exaltation.

I. His resurrection, wherein by his diuine power he subdued death, and raised vp himselfe to eternall life, 2. Cor. 13. 4. *Though he was crucified concerning his infirmity, yet liueth he through the power of God.* Math. 28. 6. *He is not here, for he is risen, as he said: Come, see the place where the Lord was laid.*

The end of Christs resurrection, was to shew that his sanctification, by his passion and death, was fully absolute. For one only sinne would haue detained the Mediatour, vnder the dominion of death, though he had fully satisfied for all the rest. 1. Cor. 15. 17. *If Christ be not raised, your faith is in vaine: ye are yet in your sinnes.* Rom. 4. 25. *Who was deliuered to death for our sinnes, and is risen againe for our iustification.*

II. His ascension into heauen, which is a true, locall, and visible translation of Christs humane nature from earth into the highest heauen of the blessed, by the vertue & power of his Deity. Act. 1. 9. *When he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken vp: for a cloud tooke him out of their sight: and and while they looked stedfastly towards heauen, as he went, behold two men stood by them in white apparell, which also said, Ye men of Galile, why stand ye gazing into heauen. This Iesus which is taken vp from you into heauen, shall come as ye haue seene him goe into heauen.* Eph. 4. 10. *He ascended farre aboue all the heauens.*

The end of Christs ascension was, that he might prepare a place for the faithfull, giue them the holy Ghost, and there enioy eternall glory. Ioh. 14. 2. *In my fathers house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would haue told you: I goe to prepare a place for you.* c. 16. 7. *If I goe not away, the Comforter will not come vnto you: but if I depart, I will send him vnto you.*

III. His sitting at the right hand of God the Father, which metaphorically signifieth, that Christ hath in the highest heauens actually all glory, power, and dominion. Heb. 1. 3. *By himselfe he hath purged our sinnes, and sitteth at the right hand of the Maiesty in the highest places.* Psal. 110. 1. *The Lord said to my Lord, sit thou at my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy foote-stoole.* 1. Cor. 15. 25. *Hee must raigne till he hath put all his enemies vnder his feet.* Act. 7. 55. *He beeing full of the holy Ghost, looked stedfastly into heauen, and saw the glory of God, and Iesus standing at the right hand of God,* Mat. 20. 21.

His regal office hath two parts: the first is; his regiment of the kingdome of heauen, part whereof is in heauen, part vpon earth, namely, the congregation of the faithfull.

In the gouernment of his Church, hee exerciseth two prerogatiues royall. The first, is, to make lawes. Iam. 4. 12. *There is one Lawgiuer which is able to saue and to destroy.* The second, is to ordaine his ministers. Ephes. 4. 11. *He gaue some to be Apostles, others Prophets, others Euangelists, some Pastours and Teachers, &c.* 1. Cor. 12. 28. *God hath ordained some in the Church; as first, Apostles, secondly, Prophets; thirdly, Teachers; then them that doe miracles, after that, the gifts of healing, helpers, gouernors, diuersity of tongues.*

Christs gouernment of the Church, is eyther by collection of it out of the world, or conseruation beeing collected. *Ephes.* 4. 12. *Psal* 110.

The second part of this Regall office, is the destruction of the kingdome of darknes. *Col.* 1. 13. *Who hath deliuered vs from the kingdome of darknes.* Psal. 2. 9. *Thou shalt crush them with a scepter of yron, and breake them in pieces like a potters vessell.* Luk. 19. 27. *Those mine enemies, that would not that I should raigne ouer them, bring hither, and slay them before me.*

The kingdome of darkenesse, is the whole company of Christs enemyes.

The prince of this kingdome, and of all the members thereof, is the diuell. Ephes. 2. 2. *Ye walked once according to the course of the world, and after the prince that ruleth in the aire, euen the prince that now worketh in the children of disobedience.* 2. Cor. 4. 4. *The God of this world hath blinded the eyes of the infidels.* 2. Corinth. 6. 15. *What concord hath Christ with Belial, or what part hath the beleeuer with the infidell?*

The members of this kingdome, and subiects to Satan, are his angels; and vnbeleeuers; among whom, the principall members are *Atheists,* who say in their heart, there is no God. *Psalme* 14. 1. And *Magitians,* who bargaine with the diuell, to accomplish their desires. 1. *Samuel,* 28. 7. *Psalm.* 58. 5. *Idolaters,* who either adore false gods, or the true God in an idol. 1. *Cor.* 10. 7. 20. *Turks* and *Iewes* are of this bunch; so are *Heretickes,* who are such as erre with pertinacy in the foundation of religion. 2. *Tim.* 2. 18. *Apostates,* or reuolters from faith in Christ Iesus. *Hebr.* 6. 6. *False Christs,* who beare men in hand, they are true Christs. *Math.* 24. 26. There were many such about the time of our Sauiour Christ his first comming, as *Iosephus* witnesseth, booke 20. of Iewish antiquities, the 11, 12. and 14. chapters. Lastly, that *Antichrist,* who as it is now apparent, can be none other but the Pope of Rome. 2. *Thes.* 2. 3. *Let no man deceiue you by any meanes, for that day shall not come, except there come a departing first, and that man of sinne be disclosed, euen the son of perdition, which is an aduersary, and exalteth himselfe against all that is called God, or that is worshipped so that he doth sit as God in the temple of God, shewing himselfe that he is God.* Reu. 13. 11, 12. *And I beheld another beast comming out of the earth, which had two horns like the Lamb, but he spake like the dragon; and he did all that the first beast could doe before him, and he caused the earth, and them that dwell therin, to worship the beast, whose deadly wound was healed.*

There were then, first, Antichrists at *Rome,* when the Bishops thereof would bee entitled *vniuersall,* or Bishops ouer the whole Church through the world: but then were they complete, when they, together with Ecclesiasticall censure, vsurped ciuill authority.

After that Christ hath subdued all his enemies, these two things shall ensue: I. The surrendring ouer of his kingdome to God the Father, as concerning the manner of regiment and spirituall policy, consisting in word and spirit together. II. The subiection of Christ, onely in regard of his humanity; the which then is, when the Sonne of God shall most fully manifest his maiesty, which before was obscured by the flesh as a vaile, so that the same flesh remaining both glorious, and vnited to the Sonne of God, may by infinite degrees appeare inferiour.

Wee may not therefore imagine, that the subiection of Christ, consisteth in diminishing the glory of the humanity, but in manifesting most fully the maiesty of the Word.
