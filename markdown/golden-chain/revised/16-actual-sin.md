# Of Actual Sin

After original sin in Adam's posterity, actual transgression taketh place. It is either inward or outward. 

## Inward Sin

Inward is of the mind, will, and affections.

### Of the Mind

The actual sin of the mind is the evil thought or intent thereof, contrary to Gods law. Examples of evil thoughts, God (the only knower of the heart) hath in divers places set down in his word.

#### I. That there is no God.

> Psalm 10:4  
> The wicked is so proud, that he seeketh not for God, he thinketh always there is no God.

> Psalm 14:1  
> The fool saith in his heart, there is no God.

#### II. That there is neither providence nor presence of God in this world.

> Psalm 10:11, 13  
> He saith in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth away his face and will never see... Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he saith in his heart, thou wilt not regard.

#### III. It imagineth safeguard to itself from all perils.

> Psalm 10:6  
> He saith in his heart, I shall never be moved nor be in danger.

> Revelation 18:7  
> She saith in her heart, I sit being a Queen, and am no widow, and shall see no mourning.

#### IV. It esteemeth itself more excellent than others.

> Revelation 18:7  
> I sit as a Queen.

> Luke 18:11,12  
> The Pharisee standing thus prayed to himself, I thank thee, O God, that I am not as other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, nor yet as this Publican... I fast twice in the week, and give tithe of all my possessions.

#### V. That the Gospel of God's kingdom is mere foolishness.

> 1 Corinthians 2:14  
> The natural man perceiveth not the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him.

#### VI. To think uncharitably and maliciously of such as serve God sincerely.

> Matthew 12:24  
> When the Pharisees heard that, they said, he casteth not out devils, but by the prince of devils.

> Psalm 74:8  
> They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them altogether.

#### VII. To think the day of death far off.

> Isaiah 28:15  
> Ye have said, we have made a covenant with death, and with hell wee are at agreement, though a scourge run over us, and pass through, it shall not come at us.

#### VIII. That the pains of hell may be eschewed. 

In the place before mentioned, they say, "With hell have we made agreement."

#### IX. That God will defer his both particular and last general coming to judgement.

> Luke 12:19  
> I will say unto my soul, Soul thou hast much goods laid up for many years...

> Luke 12:45  
> If that servant say in his heart, My master will defer his coming...

Many carnal men pretend their good meaning: but when God openeth their eyes, they shall see these rebellious thoughts rising in their minds, as sparkles out of a chimney.

### Of the Will and Affections

The actual sin of both will and affection, is every wicked motion, inclination, and desire.

> Galatians 5:17  
> The flesh lusteth against the spirit.

## Outward Sin

An actual outward sin is that, to the committing whereof, the members of the body do together with the faculties of the soul concur. Such sins as these are infinite.

> Psalm 40:12  
> Innumerable troubles have compassed me, my sins have taken such hold on me, that I am not able to look up, yea, they are more in number than the hairs of my head.

## Degrees in Committing a Sin

Actual sin is of omission or commission. Again, both these are in words or deeds.

In the sin of commission, observe these two points: the degrees in committing a sin, and the difference of sins committed.

The degrees are in number four.

> James 1:14,15  
> Every man is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own concupiscence, and is enticed: then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin; and sin when it is finished, bringeth forth death.

### Temptation

The first degree is temptation, whereby man is allured to sin. This doth Satan by offering to the mind that which is evil.

> John 13:2  
> The devil had now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son to betray him.

> Acts 5:3  
> Peter said to Ananias, Why hath Satan filled thine heart that thou shouldest lie...

> 1 Chronicles 21:1  
> And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.

This is also effected upon occasion of some external object, which the senses perceive.

> Job 31:1  
> I have made a covenant with mine eyes, why then should I look upon a maid?

Temptation hath two parts: abstraction, and inescation.

#### Abstraction

Abstraction is the first cogitation of committing sin, whereby the mind is withdrawn from God's service, to the which it should be always ready pressed.

> Luke 10:27  
> Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and all thy soul, with all thy thought.

#### Inescation

Inescation is that whereby an evil thought conceived, and for a time retained in the mind by delighting the will and affections, doth as it were, lay a bait for them to draw them to consent.

### Conception

The second degree, is conception, which is nothing else but a consent and resolution to commit sin.

> Psalm 7:14  
> He shall travel with wickedness, he hath conceived mischief, but he shall bring forth a lie.

### Birth

The third degree, is the birth of sin, namely, the committing of sin, by the assistance both of the faculties of the soul, and the powers of the body.

### Perfection

The fourth degree, is perfection, when sin being by custom perfect, and as it were ripe, the sinner reapeth death, that is, damnation.

This appeareth in the example of Pharaoh: wherefore custom in any sin is fearful.

## Differences of Sins Committed

Sin actually committed, hath five differences.

### To Consent With an Offender

First, to consent with an offender, and not actually to commit sin.

> Ephesians 5:11  
> Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but reprove them rather.

This is done three manner of ways.

#### I. When a man in judgement somewhat alloweth the sin of another.

> Numbers 20:10,12  
> Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and Moses said unto them, Hear now ye rebels: shall we bring you water out of the rock? ...The Lord spake to Moses and Aaron, because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the presence of the childing of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring the congregation into the land which I have given them.*

#### II. When the heart approveth in affection and consent. Hither may we refer both the ministers and the magistrates concealing and winking at offenses.

> 1 Samuel 2:23  
> Eli said, Why do ye such things? for of all this people I hear evil of you. Do no more my sons.

Now that Eli's will agreeth with his sons' sins, it is manifest:

> 1 Samuel 2:29  
> Thou honourest thy children above me.

#### III. In deed; by counsel, presence, enticement.

> Romans 1:31  
> They do not only do the same, but also favour them that do them.

> Mark 6:25,26  
> She said unto her mother, What shall I ask? and she said, John Baptist's head.

> Acts 22:20  
> When the blood of thy Martyr Steven was shed, I also stood by, and consented unto his death, and kept the clothes of them that slew him.

### To Sin Ignorantly

The second difference is to sin ignorantly, as when a man doth not expressly and distinctly know whether that which he doth be a sin or not, or if he know it, doth not acknowledge and mark it.

> 1 Timothy 1:13  
> I was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and an oppressor: but I was received to mercy, for I did it ignorantly through unbelief.

> Numbers 35:22-24  
> If he punished him unadvisedly, and not of hatred, or cast upon him any thing without laying of wait or any stone (whereby he might be slain) and saw him not, or caused it to fall upon him, and he die, and was not his enemy, neither sought him any harm: then the congregation shall judge between the slayer, and the avenger of blood, according to these laws.

> 1 Corinthians 4:4  
> I know nothing by my self, yet am I not thereby justified.

> Psalm 19:12 [^1]  
> Cleanse me from my secret sins.

### To Sin of Infirmity

The third difference is to sin upon knowledge, but yet of infirmity, as when a man fearing some imminent danger, or amazed at the horror of death, doth against his knowledge deny that truth which otherwise he would acknowledge and embrace. Such was Peter's fall, arising from the over-much rashness of the mind, mingled with some fear.

Thus men offend, when the flesh and inordinate desires so overrule the will and every good endeavour that they provoke man to that which he from his heart detesteth.

> Romans 7:19  
> I do not the good thing which I would, but the evil which I would not, that do I.

### To Sin Presumptuously

The fourth difference is presumptuous sinning upon knowledge.

> Psalm 19:13  
> Keep thy servant from presumptuous sins: let them not reign over me.

Hitherto belongeth:

I. Every sin committed with an high hand, that is, in some contempt of God.

> Numbers 15:30  
> The person that doth presumptuously... shall be cut off from amongst his people: because he hath despised the word of the Lord, and hath broken his commandment.

II. Presumption of God's mercy in doing evil.

> Ecclesiastes 8:11  
> Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the children of men is fully set in them to do evil.

> Romans 2:4  
> Despisest thou the riches of his bountifulness... not knowing that the bountifulness of God leadeth thee to repentance.

### To Sin With Malice

The fifth difference is to sin upon knowledge and set malice against God, and to this is the sin against the Holy Ghost referred.
