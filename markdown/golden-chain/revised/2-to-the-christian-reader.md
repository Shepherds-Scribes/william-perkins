# To the Chriſtian Reader.

CHRISTIAN Reader, there are at this day foure ſeuerall opinions of the order of Gods Predeſtination. The firſt is, of the olde and new Pelagians; who place the cauſes of Gods Predeſtination in man; in that they holde, that God did ordaine men either to life or death, according as hee did fore-ſee, that they would by their naturall Free-will, eyther reiect or receiue grace offered. The ſecond of them, who (of ſome) are tearmed Lutherans; which teach, that God fore-ſeeing, how all mankinde being ſhut vp vnder beliefe, would therefore reiect grace offered, did hereupon purpoſe to chooſe ſome to ſaluation of his meere mercie, without any reſpect of their faith or good workes, and the reſt to reiect, beeing mooued to doe this, becauſe hee did eternally fore-ſee that they would reiect his grace offered them in the Goſpell. The third Semi-Pelagian Papiſts, which aſcribe Gods predeſtination, partly to mercy, and partly to mens fore-ſeene preparations and meritorious workes. The fourth, of ſuch as teach, that the cauſe of the execution of Gods predeſtination, is his mercy in Chriſt, in them which are ſaued; and in them which periſh, the fall and corruption of man: yet ſo, as that the decree and eternall counſell of God, concerning them both, hath not any cauſe beſides his will and pleaſure. Of theſe foure opinions, the three former I labour to oppugne, as erronious, and to maintaine the laſt, as being truth, which will beare weight in the ballance of the Sanctuary.

A further diſcourſe whereof, here I make bold to offer to thy godly conſideration: in reading whereof, regard not ſo much the thing it ſelfe penned very ſlenderly, as mine intent and affection: who deſire among the reſt, to caſt my mite into the treaſurie of the Church of *England*, and, for want of gold, pearle, and pretious ſtone, to bring a Rammes skinne or twaine, and a little Goates haire, to the building of the Lords tabernacle, *Exod.* 35. 23.

The Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt grant, that according to the riches of his glory, thou maiſt be ſtrengthened by his ſpirit in the inner man, that Chriſt may dwell in thy heart by faith; to the end that thou being rooted and grounded in loue, maieſt be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the breadth, and length, and height thereof; and to know the loue of Chriſt which paſſeth knowledge, that thou maieſt be filled with all fulneſſe of God. *Amen.* Farewell, *Iuly 23* the yeare of the laſt patience of Saints. 1592
