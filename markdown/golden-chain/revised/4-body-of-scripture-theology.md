# Of the body of Scripture, and Theology.

THE Bodie of Scripture is a doctrine ſufficient to liue well.

It comprehendeth many holy ſciences, whereof one is principal, others are handmaids or retainers.

The principall ſcience is *Theologie*.

*Theologie,* is the ſcience of liuing bleſſedly for euer. Bleſſed life ariſeth from the knowledge of God, Ioh. 17. 3. *This is life eternal, that they know thee to be the only very God, and whom thou haſt ſent Chriſt Ieſus.* Iſa. 53. 11. *By his knowledge ſhal my righteous ſeruant* (viz. Chriſt) *iuſtifie many.* And therefore it ariſeth likewiſe from the knowledge of our ſelues, becauſe we know God by looking into our ſelues.

*Theologie* hath two parts: the firſt of God, the ſecond of his workes.
