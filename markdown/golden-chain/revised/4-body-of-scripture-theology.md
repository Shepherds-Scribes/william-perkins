# Of the Body of Scripture, and Theology.

The Body of Scripture is a doctrine sufficient to live well.

It comprehendeth many holy sciences, whereof one is principal, others are handmaids or retainers.

The principal science is *Theology*.

*Theology* is the science of living blessedly for ever. Blessed life ariseth from the knowledge of God: 

> John 17:3  
> This is life eternal, that they know thee to be the only very God, and whom thou hast sent Christ Jesus.

> Isaiah 53:11  
> By his knowledge shall my righteous servant *(viz. Christ)* justify many.

And therefore it ariseth likewise from the knowledge of ourselves, because we know God by looking into ourselves.

*Theology* hath two parts: the first of God, the second of his works.
