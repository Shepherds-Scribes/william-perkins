# Of the Union of the Two Natures in Christ.

Now followeth the union of the two natures in Christ, which especially concerneth his mediation, for by this union it cometh to pass that his humanity did suffer death upon the cross, in such sort as he could neither be overcome nor perpetually overwhelmed by it. Three things belong to this uniting of natures.

I. Conception, by which his human nature was by the wonderful power and operation of God, both immediately, that is, without man's help, and miraculously framed of the substance of the Virgin Mary.

> Luke 1:35  
> The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the most high shall overshadow thee.

The Holy Ghost cannot be said to be the Father of Christ, because he did minister no matter to the making of the humanity, but did only fashion and frame it of the substance of the Virgin Mary.

II. Sanctification, whereby the same human nature was purified, that is, altogether severed by the power of the Holy Ghost, from the least stain of sin, to the end that it might be holy, and be made fit to die for others.

> Luke 1:35  
> That holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.

> 1 Peter 3:18  
> Christ hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust.

> 1 Peter 2:22  
> Who did not sin, neither was there guile found in his mouth.

III. Assumption, whereby the Word, that is, the second person in Trinity, took upon him flesh, and the seed of Abraham, namely, his human nature: to the end, that it being destitute of a proper and personal subsistence, might in the person of the Word obtain it; subsisting, and as it were, being supported of the word for ever.

> John 1:14  
> That Word was made flesh.

> Hebrews 2:16  
> He took not upon him the nature of Angels, but the seed of Abraham.

In the assumption, we have three things to consider: 

I. The difference of the two natures in Christ. For the divine nature, as it is limited to the person of the Son, is perfect and actually subsisting in itself: the human nature, which consisteth in whole of body and soul, doth neither subsist in itself, nor by itself:

II. The manner of union. The person of the Son did, by assuming the human nature, create it, and by creating, assume it, communicating his subsistence unto it: the like example of union is no where to be found. 

III. The product of the union. Whole Christ, God and man, was not made a new person of the two natures, as of parts compounding a new thing; but remained still the same person. Now whereas the ancient Fathers termed Christ a "compound person," we must understand them not properly, but by proportion. For as the parts are united in the whole, so these two natures do concur together in one person, which is the Son of God.

By this we may see that Christ is one only Son of God, not two: yet in two respects he is the Son of God. As he is the eternal Word, he is by nature the Son of the Father: As he is man, the same son also, yet not by nature, or by adoption, but only by personal union. See Luke 1:35, Matthew 3:17: "This is my beloved Son..."

The phrase in Scripture agreeing to this union is the "communion of properties," which is a true and real predication: even as it ariseth of the true and real union of natures; concerning which, observe two rules.

I. Of those things which are spoken or attributed to Christ, some are only understood of his divine nature.

> John 8:58  
> Before Abraham was, I am.

> Colossians 1:15  
> Who is the image of the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature.

Some again agree only to his humanity, as "borne, suffered, dead, buried..." 

> Luke 2:52  
> And Jesus increased in wisdom, and stature, and in favour with God and man.

Lastly, other things are understood, only of both natures united together.

> Matthew 17:5  
> This is my beloved Son, in whom only I am well pleased, hear him.

> Ephesians 1:22  
> He hath made subject all things under his feet, and hath appointed him over all things to be the head to the Church.

II. Some things are spoken of Christ, as he is God, which must be interpreted according to his human nature.

> Acts 20:28  
> To feed the Church of God, [that is, Christ] which he [according to his manhood] hath purchased with his own blood.

> 1 Corinthians 2:8  
> If they had known this, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.

Contrarily, some things are mentioned of Christ, as he is man, which only are understood of his divine nature.

> John 3:13  
> No man ascended up to heaven, but he that hath descended from heaven, the Son of man which is in heaven.

This is spoken of his manhood, whereas we must understand that only his Deity came down from heaven.

> John 6:62  
> What if ye should see the Son of man [viz. Christ's human nature] ascend up, where he [viz. his Deity] was before.

Lastly, by reason of this union, Christ, as he is man, is exalted above every name; yea, he is adored, and hath such a great (though not infinite) measure of gifts, as far surpass the gifts of all Saints and Angels.

> Ephesians 1:21  
> And set him at his right hand in heavenly places, far above all principality, and power, and might, and domination, and every name that is named, not in this world only, but in that also that is to come.

> Hebrews 1:6 [^1]  
> When he bringeth his first begotten Son into the world, he saith, And let all the Angels of God worship him.

> Colossians 2:3  
> In whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden.

> Philippians 2:9-10  
> Therefore God exalted him on high, and gave him a name above all names, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow [namely, worship, and be subject to him] both of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth.
