# Of the Distinction of Both Natures.

The distinction of both natures is that whereby they, with their properties and operations, remain distinct without composition, mingling, or conversion.

> John 10:17-18  
> Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my self, I have power to lay it down, and have power to take it again.

> John 13:31-32  
> Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself.

Here we may observe that there is one will in Christ as God; another, as man.

> Matthew 26:39  
> Not as I will, but as thou wilt.

This also approveth the sentence of the Chalcedon Creed: "We confess, that one and the same Christ Jesus, both Son, Lord, only begotten, is known and preached to be in two natures without confusion, mutation, distinction, or separation."

Lastly, hereby it is manifest, that Christ, when he became that which he was not (namely man) continued still that which he was (very God.)
