# Of Man's Fall and Disobedience

Adam's fall was his willing revolting to disobedience by eating the forbidden fruit. In Adam's fall, we may note the manner, greatness, and fruit of it.

## I. The Manner

The manner of Adam's fall was on this sort: First, the devil, having immediately before fallen himself, insinuateth unto our first parents that both the punishment for eating the forbidden fruit was uncertain, and that God was not true in his word unto them. Secondly, by this legerdemain, he blinded the eyes of their understanding. Thirdly, being thus blinded, they begin to distrust God, and to doubt of God's favour. Fourthly, they thus doubting, are moved to behold the forbidden fruit. Fifthly, they no sooner see the beauty thereof, but they desire it. Sixthly, that they may satisfy their desire, they eat of the fruit, which by the hands of the woman was taken from the tree: by which act they become utterly disloyal to God. See Genesis 3:1-8.

Thus without constraint, they willingly fall from their integrity; God upon just causes leaving them to themselves, and freely suffering them to fall. For we must not think that mans fall was either by chance, or God not knowing of it; or barely winking at it, or by his bare permission, or against his will: but rather miraculously, not without the will of God, and yet without all approbation of it.

## II. The Greatness

The greatness of this transgression must be esteemed, not by the external object, or the baseness of an apple, but by the offence it containeth against God's majesty. This offence appeareth by many trespasses committed in that action:

1. Doubting of God's word
2. Want of faith; for they believe not God's threatening, "In that day ye eat thereof, you shall die the death"; but being bewitched with the devil's promise, "ye shall be like Gods," they cease to fear God's punishment, and are inflamed with a desire of greater dignity.
3. Their curiosity, in forsaking God's word, and seeking other wisdom.
4. Their pride, in seeking to magnify themselves, and to become like God.
5. Contempt of God, in transgressing his commandments against their own conscience. 
6. In that they prefer the devil before God.
7. Ingratitude, that inasmuch as in them lieth, they expel God's spirit dwelling in them, and despise that everlasting blessed union.
8. They murder both themselves and their progeny.

## III. The Fruit

The fruit or effects. Out of this corrupt state of our first parents, arose the state of infidelity or unbelief, whereby God hath included all men under sin, that he might manifest his mercy in the salvation of some, and his justice in the condemnation of others.

> Romans 11:32  
> God hath shut up all men in unbelief, that he might have mercy on all.

> Galatians 3:22  
> The Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by the faith of Jesus Christ should be given to them that believe.*

In this state, we must consider sin and the punishment of sin. Sin is three-fold.

The first is the participation of Adam's both transgression and guiltiness, whereby in his sin, all his posterity sinned.

> Romans 5:12  
> As by one man sin entered into the world, and by sin death: so death entered upon all men, in that all men have sinned.

The reason of this is ready. Adam was not then a private man, but represented all mankind, and therefore look what good he received from God, or evil elsewhere, both were common to others with him

> 1 Corinthians 15:22  
> As in Adam all men die, so in Christ all men rise again.

Again, when Adam offended, his posterity was in his loins, from whom they should by the course of nature issue: and therefore take part of the guiltiness with him.

> Hebrews 7:9,10  
> And to say as the thing is, Levi... payed tithes to Melchizedec: for he was yet in the loins of his father Abraham, when Melchizedec met him.*
