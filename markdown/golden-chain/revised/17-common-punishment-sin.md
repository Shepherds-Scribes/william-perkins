# Of the Common Punishment of Sin

Hitherto we have treated of sin, wherewith all mankind is infected: in the next place succeedeth the punishment of sin, which is threefold. 

## In This Life

The first is in this life, and that divers ways. 

### I. The Body

The first concerneth the body, either in the provision with trouble for the things of this life (Genesis 3:17) or a proneness to diseases:

> Matthew 9:2  
> Son, be of good comfort, thy sins be forgiven thee.

> John 5:14  
> Behold, thou art made whole, sin no more, lest a worse thing fall upon thee.

> Deuteronomy 28:21-22  
> The Lord shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee, until he hath consumed thee from the land.

Or shame of nakedness (Genesis 3:7), or in women pains in child-birth: 

> Genesis 3:16  
> Unto the woman he said, I will greatly increase thy sorrows, and conceptions: in sorrow shalt thou bring forth children.

### II. The Soul

The soul is punished with trembling of conscience, care, trouble, hardness of heart, and madness.

> Deuteronomy 28:28  
> The Lord shall smite thee with madness, and with blindness, and with a stonying of heart.

### III. The Whole Man

The whole man is punished:

#### With fearful subjection to the regiment of Satan.

> Colossians 1:13  
> Which freed us from the power of darkness, and translated us into the kingdom of his beloved Son.

> Hebrews 2:14  
> He also himself took part with them, that he might destroy through death, him that had power of death, that is the devil.

#### A separation from the fellowship of God, and trembling at his presence.

> Ephesians 4:18  
> Having their cogitation darkened, and being strangers from the life of God.

> Genesis 3:10  
> I heard thy voice in the garden, and was afraid, because I was naked, therefore I hid myself.

### IV. A Man's Goods

Upon a man's goods, divers calamities and damages.

> Deuteronomy 28:29  
> Thou shalt ever be oppressed with wrong, and be pouled, and no man shall succour thee.

To this place may be referred distinction of Lordships: and of this cometh a care to enlarge them, and bargaining with all manner of civil servitudes.

### V. Authority Over Creation

The loss of that lordly authority, which man had over all creatures; also their vanity, which is not only a weakening, but also a corrupting of that excellency of the virtues and powers which God at the first put into them.

> Romans 8:20-21  
> The creature is subject to vanity, not of its own will, but by reason of him, which hath subdued it under hope.

### VI. Infamy

In a man's name, infamy and ignominy sometimes after his death. See Jeremiah 24:6.

## At Death

The second is at the last gasp, namely, death, or a change like unto death.

> Romans 6:23  
> The wages of sin is death.

## After This Life

The third is after this life, even eternal destruction from God's presence, and his exceeding glory.

> 2 Thessalonians 1:9  
> Who shall be punished with everlasting perdition from the presence of God, and the glory of his power.
