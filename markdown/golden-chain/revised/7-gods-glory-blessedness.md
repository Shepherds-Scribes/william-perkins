# Of God's Glory and Blessedness

Out of the former attributes, by which the true Jehovah is distinguished from a feigned God and from Idols, arise the glory of God and his blessedness.

God's glory or majesty is the infinite excellency of his most simple and most holy divine Nature. 

> Hebrews 1:3  
> Who being the brightness of his glory, and the engraved form of his person..

> Nehemiah 9:5  
> Let them praise thy glorious name, O God, which excellest above all thanksgiving and praise.

By this we see, that God only can know himself perfectly. 

> John 6:46  
> Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father.

> 1 Timothy 6:16  
> Who only hath immortality, and dwelleth in the light that none can attain unto, whom never man saw, neither can see.

> Exodus 33:20  
> Thou canst not see my face.

Notwithstanding there is a certain manifestation of God's glory: partly more obscure, partly more apparent.

The more obscure manifestation is the vision of God's majesty in this life, by the eyes of the mind, through the help of things perceived by outward senses. 

> Isaiah 6:1  
> I saw the Lord sitting upon an high throne, and lifted up, and the lower parts thereof filled the Temple.

> Exodus 33:22  
> And while my glory passeth by, I will put thee in a cleft of the Rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by: after I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts, but my face shall not be seen.

> 1 Corinthians 13:12  
> Now we see as through a glass darkly.

The more apparent manifestation of God is the contemplation of him in heaven face to face. 

> 1 Corinthians 13:12  
> But then shall we see face to face.

> Daniel 7:9,10  
> I beheld till the thrones were set up, and the ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow...

God's blessedness is that by which God is in himself, and of himself, all-sufficient. 

> Genesis 17:1  
> I am God all-sufficient, walk before me, and be thou upright.

> Colossians 2:9  
> For in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.

> 1 Timothy 6:15  
> Which in due time he shall shew, that is blessed and Prince only.
