# Of Predestination and Creation.

God's decree, inasmuch as it concerneth man, is called predestination: which is the decree of God, by the which he hath ordained all men to a certain and everlasting state: that is, either to salvation or condemnation, for his own glory. 

> 1 Thessalonians 5:9  
> For God hath not appointed us unto wrath, but to obtain salvation by the means of our Lord Jesus Christ.

> Romans 9:13,22  
> As it is written, I have loved Jacob, and hated Esau... What and if God would, to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, suffer with long patience the vessels of wrath prepared to destruction: and that he might declare the riches of his glory upon the vessels of mercy, which he hath prepared unto glory?

The means of accomplishing God's predestination are twofold: The creation, and the fall.

The creation, is that by which God made all things very good, of nothing; that is, of no matter which was before the creation.

> Genesis 1:1  
> In the beginning God created the heaven...

God's manner of creating, as also of governing, is such, as that by his word alone, he without any instruments, means, assistance, or motion, produced all sorts of things: For to will any thing with God, is both to be able and to perform it.

> Hebrews 11:3  
> By faith we understand, that the world was ordained by the word of God, so that the things which we see, are not made of things which did appear.

> Psalm 148:5  
> Let them praise the name of the Lord, for he commanded, and they were created.

The goodness of the creature is a kind of excellency, by which it was void of all defect, whether punishment or fault.

The creation is of the world, or inhabitants in the world.

The world is a most beautiful palace, framed out of a deformed substance, and fit to be inhabited.

The parts of the world, are the heavens and earth.

The heavens are threefold: the first is the air, the second the sky, the third an invisible and incorporeal essence, created to be the seat of all the blessed, both men and angels. This third heaven is called Paradise (2 Corinthians 12:4).

The inhabitants of the world are reasonable creatures, made according to God's own image; they are either angels or men.

> Genesis 1:26 [^1]  
> Furthermore, God said, Let us make man in our own image, according to our likeness. 

> Job 1:6  
> When the children of God came and stood before the Lord, Satan came also among them.

The image of God is the goodness of the reasonable creature, resembling God in holiness. 

> Ephesians 4:24  
> And put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.
