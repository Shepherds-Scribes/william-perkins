# Of Election, and of Jesus Christ the Foundation Thereof

Predestination hath two parts: election and reprobation.

> 1 Thessalonians 5:9  
> God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by the means of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Election is God's decree, whereby on his own free will he hath ordained certain men to salvation, to the praise of the glory of his grace.

> Ephesians 1:4-6  
> He hath chosen us in him, before the foundation of the world, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace.

This decree is that book of life wherein are written the names of the Elect.

> Revelation 20:12  
> Another book was opened, which is the book of life, and the dead were judged of those things, that were written in the books according to their works.

> 2 Timothy 2:19 [^1]  
> The foundation of God remaineth sure, and hath this seal, the Lord knoweth who are his.

The execution of this decree is an action by which God, even as he purposed with himself, worketh all those things effectually which he decreed for the salvation of the Elect. For they whom God elected to this end, that they should inherit eternal life, were also elected to those subordinate means, whereby, as by steps, they might attain this end: and without which it were impossible to obtain it.

> Romans 8:29-30  
> Those which he knew before, he also predestinated to be made like to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn amongst many brethren: Moreover, whom he predestinated, them he called, whom he called, them he justified, and whom he justified, them also he glorified.

There appertain three things to the execution of this decree. First, the foundation. Secondly, the means. Thirdly, the degrees.

The foundation is Christ Jesus, called of his Father from all eternity, to perform the office of the Mediator, that in him all those which should be saved, might be chosen.

> Hebrews 5:5  
> Christ took not to himself this honor, to be made the high Priest, but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, this day begat I thee, gave it him...

> Isaiah 42:1  
> Behold my servant: I have put my spirit upon him, he shall bring forth judgement to the Gentiles.

> Ephesians 1:4  
> He hath chosen us in him [meaning Christ]

Question: How can Christ be subordinate unto God's election, seeing he together with the Father decree all things?

Answer: Christ, as he is a Mediator, is not subordinate to the very decree itself of election but to the execution thereof only.

> 1 Peter 1:20  
> Christ was ordained before the foundation of the world.

Augustine in his book of the Predestination of the Saints, chapter 15: "Christ was predestinated that he might be our head."

In Christ, we must especially observe two things: his incarnation, and his office.

To the working of his incarnation concur three things: first, both his natures; secondly, their union; thirdly, their distinction.

Christ's first nature is the Godhead, inasmuch as it belongeth to the Son, whereby he is God.

> Philippians 2:6  
> Who being in the form of God, thought it no robbery to be equal with God.

> John 1:1  
> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and that Word was God.

It was requisite for the Mediator to be God:

1. That he might the better sustain that great misery, wherewith mankind was overwhelmed; the greatness whereof, these four things declare:
    1. The grievousness of sin, wherewith God's majesty was infinitely offended.
    2. God's infinite anger against this sin.
    3. The fearful power of death. 
    4. The devil's tyranny, who is prince of this world.
2. That he might make his human nature both of plentiful merit, and also of sufficient efficacy, for the work of man's redemption.
3. That he might instill into all the elect eternal life and holiness.

> Isaiah 43:11-12 [^2]  
> I am the Lord and there is none besides me a Savior, I have declared, and I have saved, and I have shewed, when there was no strange god among you; therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am God.

I say, the Godhead, as it is the Godhead of the Son, is Christ's divine nature: not as it is the Godhead of the Father, or of the Holy Ghost; for it is the office of the Son, to have the administration of every outward action of the Trinity, from the Father, by the Holy Ghost. 

> 1 Corinthians 8:6  
> And he being by nature the Son of the Father, bestoweth this privilege on those that believe, that they are the sons of God by adoption.

> John 1:12  
> As many as received him, to them he gave power to be the sons of God.

If either the Father or the Holy Ghost should have been incarnated, the title of Son should have been given to one of them who was not the Son by eternal generation: and so there should be more sons then one.

Christ's other nature is his humanity, whereby he, the Mediator, is very man.

> 1 Timothy 2:5  
> One God, and one Mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus.

It was necessary that Christ should be man. First, that God might be pacified in that nature whereby he was offended. Secondly, that he might undergo punishment due to sin, the which the Godhead could not, being void and free from all passion.

Furthermore, Christ, as he is man, is like unto us in all things, sin only excepted.

> Hebrews 2:17  
> In all things it became him to be made like unto his brethren.

See also 2 Corinthians 13:4.

Christ therefore is a perfect man, consisting of an essential and true soul and body, whereunto are joined such faculties and properties as are essential unto both. In his soul is understanding, memory, will, and such like; in his body, length, breadth, and thickness; yea, it is comprehended in one only place, visible, subject to feeling, neither is there anything wanting in him which may either adorn or make for the being of man's nature.

Again, Christ in his humanity, was subject to the infirmities of man's nature, which are these:

I. To be tempted. 

> Matthew 4:1  
> Jesus was carried by the spirit into the desert, to be tempted of the devil.

II. To fear.

> Hebrews 5:7  
> Who in the days of his flesh, did offer up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears, unto him that was able to save him from death, and was also heard in that which he feared.

III. To be angry.

> Mark 3:5  
> Then he looked round about on them angrily, mourning also for the hardness of their hearts, and said unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand.

IV. Forgetfulness of his office imposed upon him, by reason of the agony astonishing his senses.

> Matthew 26:39  
> He went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.

We must hold these things concerning Christ's infirmities:

1. They were such qualities as did only affect his human nature, and not at all constitute the same: and therefore might be left of Christ.
2. They were such as were common to all men: as to thirst, to be weary, and subject to die: and not personal, as are agues, consumptions, the leprosy, blindness, and so on.
3. He was subject to these infirmities, not by necessity of his human nature, but by his free will and pleasure, pitying mankind. Therefore in him such infirmities were not the punishment of his own sin, as they are in us; but rather part of that his humiliation which he did willingly undergo for our sakes.
