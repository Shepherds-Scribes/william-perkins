# Of the firſt commandement.

THE firſt table hath foure commaundements.

The firſt teacheth vs to haue and chooſe the true God for our God. The words are theſe.

*I am Iehouah thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, & out of the houſe of bondage. Thou ſhalt haue none other gods before my face.

## The Reſolution.

*I am.* If any man rather iudge, that theſe words are a preface to all the commaundements, then a part of the firſt, I hinder him not: neuertheles, it is like, that they are a perſwaſion to the keeping of the firſt commaundement: and that they are ſet before it, to make way vnto it; as being more hard to be receiued, then the reſt. And this may appeare, in that the three commaundements next following, which are leſſe then this, haue their ſeuerall reaſons.

*Iehouah.* This word ſignifieth three things. I. Him who of himſelfe, and in himſelfe, was from all eternitie. Reu. 1. 8. *Who is, who was, & who is to come.* II. Him which giueth being to all things, when they were not, partly by creating, partly by preſeruing them. III. Him which mightily cauſeth, that thoſe things which hee hath promiſed, ſhould both bee made, and continued. *Exodus* 6. 1. *Romanes* 4. 17.

Here beginneth the firſt reaſon of the firſt commaundement, taken from the name of God: it is thus framed:

*He that is Iehouah, muſt alone be thy God.*
*But I am Iehouah:*
*Therefore I alone muſt be thy God.*

This propoſition is wanting: the aſſumption is in theſe words (*I am Iehouah*) the concluſion is the commaundement.

*Thy God.* Theſe are the words of the couenant of grace. *Ier.* 31. 33. wherein the Lord couenanteth with his people concerning remiſsion of ſinnes, and eternall life. Yea theſe words are as a ſecond reaſon of the commaundements, drawne from the equality of that relation, which is betweene God and his people.

*If I be thy God, thou againe muſt be my people, and take me alone for thy God.*
*But I am thy God:*
*Therefore thou muſt be my people, and take me alone for thy God.*

*Which brought.* The aſſumption or ſecond part of this reaſon, is confirmed by an argument taken from Gods effects, when he deliuered his people out of Egypt, as it were, fró the ſeruitude of a moſt tyranous maſter. This deliuery was not appropriate onely to the Iſraelites, but in ſome ſort belongs to the Church of God in all ages: in that it was a type of a moſt ſurpaſsing deliuery, from the fearefull kingdome of darkeneſſe. 1. Cor. 10. 1, 2. *I would not haue you ignorant, brethren, that all our fathers were vnder the cloud, & all paſſed through the redde ſea, and were all baptized vnto Moſes in the cloud, and in the ſea. Coloſſ. 1. 13. *Who hath deliuered vs from the power of darkeneſſe, and tranſlated vs into the kingdome of his deare Sonne.*

*Other gods, or ſtrange gods.* They are ſo called, not that they by nature are ſuch, or can bee; but becauſe the corrupt, and more than diueliſh heart of carnall man, eſteemeth ſo of them. Philip. 3. 19. *Whoſe god is their belly.* 2 Corin. 4. 4. *Whoſe minds the god of this world hath bewitched.*

*Before my face.* That is, (figuratiuely) in my fight or preſence, to whome the ſecret imaginations of the heart are knowne: and this is the third reaſon of the firſt commaundement, as if he ſhould ſay: If thou in my preſence reiect me, it is an heinous offence: ſee therefore thou doe it not. After the ſame manner reaſoneth the Lord. Gen. 17. 1. *I am God almighty, therefore walke before me, and be thou vpright.*

## The affirmatiue part.

*Make choice of Iehouah to be thy God.*

The duties here commanded, are theſe:

I. To acknowledge God, that is, to know and confeſſe him to be ſuch a God, as he hath reuealed himſelfe to bee in his word and creatures. Coloſſ. 1. 10. *Increaſing in the knowledge of God.* Ierem. 24. 7. *And I will giue them an heart to know me, that I am the Lord, and they ſhall be my people, and I will be their God: for they ſhall returne vnto me with their whole heart.* In this knowledge of God muſt wee glory, *Ier.* 9. 24. *Let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he vnderſtandeth and knoweth mee: for I am the Lord which ſheweth mercy, iudgement, and righteouſnes in the earth.*

II. An vnion with God, whereby man is knit in heart with God. *Ioſh.* 23. 8. *Sticke faſt vnto the Lord your God, as ye haue done vnto this day.* Act. 11. 23. *He exhorted all, that with purpoſe of heart, they would cleaue to the Lord.* Man cleaueth vnto God three manner of waies: in affiance, in loue, and feare of God.

Affiance, is that whereby a man acknowledging the power and mercy of God, doth ſtedfaſtly reſt himſelfe in him, againſt all aſſaults whatſoeuer. 2. Chr. 20. 20 *Put your truſt in the Lord your God, and ye ſhall be aſſured, beleeue his Prophets, and ye ſhal proſper.* Pſal. 27. 1. *God is my light, and my ſaluation, who ſhall I feare? God is the ſtrength of my life, of whom ſhould I be afraid?* v.3. *Though an hoſt be pitched againſt me, mine heart ſhall not be afraid: though war be raiſed againſt me, I will be ſecure.*

Hence ariſeth patience and alacrity in preſent perils. Pſal. 39. 9. *I ſhould haue bin dumbe, and not opened my mouth, becauſe thou didſt it.* 2. Sam. 16. 10. *The king ſaid, What haue I to doe with you, ye ſons of Zeruiah? If he curſed, becauſe the Lord ſaid, Curſe Dauid, what is he that dare ſay, why doeſt thou ſo?* Gen. 45. 5. *Be not ſad, neither grieued with your ſelues, that ye ſold me hither: for God did ſend me before you for your preſeruation.* v. 8. *Now then, you ſent me not, but God himſelfe.* 2. King. 6. 16. *Feare not, for they that be with vs, are moe, then they that be with them.*

This affiance engendreth hope, which is a patient expectation of Gods preſence & aſsiſtance in all things that are to come. Pſ. 37. 5. *Cómit thy way vnto the Lord, & truſt in him, & he ſhal bring it to paſse.* v. 7. *Wait patiently vpó the Lord, & hope in him.* Pro. 16. 3. *Cómit thy work vnto the Lord, and thy thoughts ſhall be directed.*

The loue of God, is that, whereby man acknowledging Gods goodneſſe and fauour towards him, doth againe loue him aboue all things. Deut. 6. 5. *Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God with all thine heart, with all thy ſoule, and with all thy ſtrength.*

The markes of the true loue of God are theſe: I. To heare willingly his word. II. To ſpeake often of him. III. To thinke often of him. IV. To doe his will without irkſomnes. V. To giue body, and all for his cauſe. VI. To deſire his preſence aboue all, and to bewaile his abſence. VII. To embrace all ſuch things as appertaine to him. VIII. To loue and hate that which he loueth and hateth. IX. In all things to ſeeke to pleaſe him. X. To draw others vnto the loue of him. XI. To eſteeme highly of ſuch gifts and graces, as he beſtoweth. XII. To ſtay our ſelues vpon his counſels reuealed in his word. Laſtly, to call vpon his name with affiance.

The feare of God, is that whereby man acknowledging both Gods mercy and iuſtice, doth, as the greateſt euill, feare to diſpleaſe God. Pſal. 130. 4. *With thee is mercy, that thou maieſt be feared.* Habak. 3. 16. *When I heard it, my belly trembled, my lips ſhooke at the voice: rottennes entred into my bones, and I trembled in my ſelfe, that I might reſt in the day of trouble, when he commeth vp againſt the people to deſtroy them.* Pſal. 4. 4. *Tremble, and ſinne not.*

Hence ariſeth the godly mans deſire, to approue himſelfe in al things to his God. Gen. 5. 22. *And Henoch walked with God, after that, &c.* Gen. 17. 1. *God ſaid to him, I am al-ſufficient, walke before me, and be thou perfect.*

Out of theſe three former vertues proceedeth humility, wherby a man acknowledging Gods free bounty, and proſtrating himſelfe before him, doth aſcribe vnto him all prayſe & glory. 1. Cor. 1. 31. *Let him that glorieth, glory in the Lord.* 1. Pet. 5. 5. *Decke your ſelues inwardly with lowlineſſe of mind, for God reſiſteth the proud, and giueth grace to the humble.* ver. 6. *Humble your ſelues therefore vnder the mightie hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time.* 1 Chr. 29. 10. 11. *And Dauid ſaid, Bleſſed be thou O Lord God of Iſrael our father for euer, and thine, O Lord, is greatnes and power, and glory, and victory, and praiſe: for all that is in heauen, and in earth is thing, & c.* & v. 14. *But who am I, and what is my people, that wee ſhould be able to offer willingly on this ſort: for all things come of thee, & of thine own hand we haue giué thee, &c.*

## The netatiue part.

*Account not that as God, which is by nature no God.*

In this place are theſe ſinnes forbidden:

I. Ignorance of the true God and his will, which is not onely not to know, but alſo to doubt of ſuch things, as God hath reuealed in his word. *Ier.* 4. 22. *My people is fooliſh, they haue not knowne me: they are fooliſh children, and haue not vnderſtanding: they are wiſe to do euill, but to doe well they haue no knowledge.* *Ier.* 9. 3. *They proceede from euill to worſe, and haue not knowne me, ſaith the Lord.*

II. Atheiſme, when the heart denieth eyther God, or his attributes: as, his Iuſtice, Wiſedome, Prouidence, Preſence, Pſal. 14. 1. *The foole hath ſaid in his heart, there is no God.* Epheſ. 2. 12. *Ye had no hope, and were without God in the world.* Mal. 1. 2. *I loue you, ſaith the Lord, yet ye ſay, wherein haue we ſpoken againſt thee?* and cha. 3. 14. *Ye haue ſaid, it is in vaine to ſerue God: and what profit is it, that we haue kept his commandements, and that we walked humbly before the Lord of hoſts?

III. Errours concerning God, the perſons of the Deity, or the attributes. Here is to bee reprooued Helleniſme, which is the acknowledging and adoring of a multiplicitie of Gods. *Auguſt.* in his 6. booke of the City of God. chap. 7.

Againe, Iudaiſme is here condemned, which worſhippeth one GOD without Chriſt.

The like may be ſaid of the hereſies of the Manichees, and Marcian, who denied God to be the creatour of the world: of *Sabellius* denying the diſtinction of three perſons: and *Arrius*, who ſaith, that Chriſt the Sonne of God, is not very God.

IV. To withdraw, and remooue the affections of the heart from the Lord, & ſet them vpon other things. Eſa. 29. 13. *The Lord ſaid, this people draweth neere me with their mouth, & honoreth me with their lips, but their heart is farre from me.* *Ier.* 12. 2. *Thou art neere in their mouth, and farre from their reines.* The heart is many waies withdrawne from God.

I. By diſtruſt in God. Heb. 10. 38. *The iuſt ſhal liue by faith, but if any withdraw himſelfe, my ſoule ſhall haue no pleaſure in him.* From this diffidence ariſe. I. Impatience in ſuffering afflictions. *Ier.* 20. 14. *Curſed be the day wherin I was borne, and let not the day wherein my mother bare me, be bleſſed.* v. 13. *Curſed be the man that ſhewed my father, ſaying, a man-child is born vnto thee and comforted him.* v. 18. *How is it that I came forth of the wombe to ſee labour and ſorrow, that my dayes ſhould bee conſumed with ſhame?* II. Tempting of God, when ſuch as diſtruſt, or rather contemne him, ſeeke experiment of Gods truth and power. Math. 4. 7. *Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God.* 1. Cor. 10. 9. *Neither let vs tempt God, as they tempted him, and were deſtroyed by ſerpents.* v. 10. *Neither murmure ye, as ſome of them murmued, and were deſtroyed of the deſtroyer.* III. Deſperation. Gen. 4. 13. *Mine iniquity is greater then can be pardoned.* 1. Theſſ. 4. 13. *Sorrow ye not, as they which haue no hope.* IV. Doubtfulneſſe, concerning the truth of God, or of his benefits preſent, or to come. Pſalme 116. 21. *I ſaid in my haſte, all men are lyars.*

II. Confidence in creatures, whether it be in their ſtrength, as *Ierem.* 17. 5. *Curſed is the man that hath his confidence in man, and maketh fleſh his arme, but his heart ſlideth from the Lord.* Or riches. Math. 6. 24. *Ye cannot ſerue God and riches.* *Eph.* 5. 5. *No couetous perſó, which is an idolater, hath inheritance in the kingdom of Chriſt and of God.* Or defenced places. *Ierem.* 49. 16. *Thy feare, & the pride of thine heart hath deceiued thee, that thou dwelleſt in the clefts of the Rocke, and keepeſt the height of the hill: though thou ſhouldeſt make thy neaſt as high as the Eagle, I will bring thee downe from thence, ſaith the Lord. Or pleaſure, and dainties: to ſuch their belly is their God, *Phil.* 3. 19. Or in Phyſitians. 2. *Chr.* 16. 12. *And Aſa in the nine & thirtieth yeare of his raigne, was diſeaſed in his feete, and his diſeaſe was extreame, yet he ſought not the Lord in his diſeaſe, but to Phyſitians.* Briefely, to this place, principally may be adioyned that diueliſh confidence which Magitians, and all ſuch as take aduiſe at them, doe put in the diuell and his workes. Leuit. 20. 6. *If any turne after ſuch as worke with ſpirits, and after ſoothſayers, to goe a whoring after them, then will I ſet my face againſt that perſon, and will cut him off from among his people.*

III. The loue of the creature, aboue the loue of God. Matth. 10. 37. *He that loueth father or mother more then me, is not worthy of me, and he that loueth ſonne or daughter more then me, is not worthy of me.* Ioh. 12. 43. *They loued the praiſe of man, more then the praiſe of God.* To this belongeth ſelf-loue, 2. Tim. 3. 2.

IV. Hatred and contempt of God, when man, by reaſon of his declining nature from God, doth flye from him, and is angry towards God when he puniſheth ſinne. Rom. 8. 7. *The wiſedome of the fleſh, is enmity with God.* Rom. 1. 30. *Haters of GOD, doers of wrong.*

V. Want of the feare of God. Pſalm. 36. 1. *Wickedneſſe ſaith to the wicked man, euen in mine heart, that there is no feare of God before their eyes.*

VI. Feare of the creature, more then the Creator. Reu. 21. 8. *The fearefull and vnbeleeuing, ſhal haue their part in the lake which burnes with fire and brimstone.* Mat. 10. 28. *Feare not them which kill the body, but feare him that can caſt both body and ſoule into hell fire.* *Ierem.* 10. 2. *Be not afraid of the ſignes of heauen, though the heathen be afraid of ſuch.*

VII. Hardnes of heart, or carnall ſecurity, when a man, neither acknowledging Gods iudgements, nor his owne ſinnes, dreameth he is ſafe from Gods vengeance, and ſuch perils, as ariſe from ſinne. Rom. 2. 5. *Thou after thine hardneſſe, and heart that can not repent, heapeſt to thy ſelfe wrath againſt the day of wrath.* Luk. 21. 34. *Take heed to your ſelues, leſt at any time your hearts be oppreſſed with ſurfetting, and drunkennes, and cares of this life, and leaſt that they come on you at unawares.*

VIII. Theſe all doe ioyntly ingender pride, whereby man aſcribeth all he hath that is good, not to God, but to his own merit, and induſtry, referring and diſpoſing them wholly vnto his owne proper credit. 1. Corin. 4. 6. *That ye might learne by vs, that no man preſume aboue that which is written, that one ſwell not againſt another, for any mans cauſe.* v. 7. *For who ſeparateth thee? or what haſt thou, that thou haſt not receiued? if thou haſt receiued it, why reioyceſt thou, as though thou hadſt not receiued it?* Gen. 3. 5. *God doth know, that when ye ſhall eate thereof, your eyes ſhall be opened, and ye ſhall be as Gods, knowing good and euill.* The higheſt ſtayre of prides ladder, is that fearfull preſumption, by which many clime raſhly into Gods ſeate of maieſty, as if they were gods. Act. 12. 22, 23. *The people gaue a ſhoute, ſaying, The voice of God, and not of man: but immediately the Angell of the Lord ſmote him, becauſe he gaue not glory vnto God, ſo that he was eaten vp of wormes, and gaue vp the ghoſt.* 2. Theſſ. 2. 4. *Which is an aduerſary, and exalteth himſelfe againſt all that is called God, or that is worſhipped: ſo that he doth ſit as God in the temple of God, ſhewing himſelfe that he is God.*
