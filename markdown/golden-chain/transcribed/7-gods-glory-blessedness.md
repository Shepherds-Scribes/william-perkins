# Of Gods glorie, and bleſſedneſſe.

OVt of the former attributes, by which the true Iehouah is diſtinguiſhed from a fained God, and from Idols, ariſe the glorie of God, and his bleſſedneſſe.

Gods glorie or maieſtie, is the infinite excellencie of his moſt ſimple and moſt holy diuine Nature. Heb. 1. 3. *Who being the brightnes of his glorie, and the ingraued forme of his perſon, &c.* Nehem. 9. 5. Let them praiſe thy glorious name, O God, which excelleſt aboue all thankeſgiuing and praiſe.

By this we ſee, that God onely can know himſelfe perfectly. Ioh. 6. 46. *Not that any man hath ſeene the Father, ſaue he which is of God, he hath ſeen the Father.* 1. Tim. 6. 16. *Who only hath immortalitie, and dwelleth in the light that none can attaine vnto, whom neuer man ſaw, neither can ſee.* Exod. 33. 20. *Thou canſt not ſee my face.*

Notwithſtanding there is a certaine manifeſtation of Gods glory: partly more obſcure, partly more apparent.

The more obſcure manifeſtation, is the viſion of Gods maieſtie in this life, by the eyes of the minde through the helpe of things perceiued by outward ſenſes. Iſa. 6. 1. *I ſaw the Lord ſitting vpon an high throne, and lifted vp, and the lower parts therof filled the Temple.* Exod. 33. 22. *And while my glory paſſeth by, I will put thee in a cleft of the Rocke, and will couer thee with my hand whiles I paſſe by: after I will take away mine hand, and thou ſhalt ſee my backe parts, but my face ſhall not be ſeene.* 1. Cor. 13. 12. *Now we ſee as through a glaſſe darkely.*

The more apparent manifeſtation of God, is the contemplation of him in heauen face to face. 1. Cor. 13. 12. *But then ſhall we ſee face to face.* Dan. 7. 9, 10. *I beheld till the thrones were ſet vp, and the ancient of daies did ſit, whoſe garment was white as ſnow, &c.*

Gods bleſſednes, is that by which God is in himſelfe, and of himſelfe all-ſufficient. Gen. 17. 1. *I am God all-ſufficient, walke before me, and be thou vpright.* Col. 2. 9. *For in him dwels all the fulneſſe of the Godhead bodily.* 1 Tim. 6. 15. *Which in due time he ſhall ſhew, that is bleſſed and Prince only.*
