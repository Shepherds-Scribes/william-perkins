# Of Predeſtination and Creation.

GOds decree, as much as it concerneth man, is called Predeſtination: which is the decree of God, by the which he hath ordained all men to a certaine and euerlaſting eſtate: that is, either to ſaluation or condemnation, for his owne glory. 1. Theſſ. 5. 9. *For God hath not appointed vs vnto wrath, but to obtaine ſaluation by the meanes of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.* Rom. 9. 13. *As it is written, I haue loued Iacob, and hated Eſau:* and verſ. 22. *What and if God would, to ſhew his wrath, and to make his power knowne, ſuffer with long patience the veſſels of wrath prepared to deſtruction: and that he might declare the riches of his glory vpon the veſſels of mercy, which hee hath prepared vnto glorie?*

The meanes of accompliſhing Gods Predeſtination are two fold.

The creation, and the fall.

The creation, is that by which GOD made all things very good, of nothing; that is, of no matter which was before the creation. Gen. 1. 1. *In the beginning God created the heauen, &c.* to the end of the chapter.
