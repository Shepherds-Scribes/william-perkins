# Of Predeſtination and Creation.

GOds decree, in as much as it concerneth man, is called Predeſtination: which is the decree of God, by the which he hath ordained all men to a certaine and euerlaſting eſtate: that is, either to ſaluation or condemnation, for his owne glory. 1. Theſſ. 5. 9. *For God hath not appointed vs vnto wrath, but to obtaine ſaluation by the meanes of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.* Rom. 9. 13. *As it is written, I haue loued Iacob, and hated Eſau:* and verſ. 22. *What and if God would, to ſhew his wrath, and to make his power knowne, ſuffer with long patience the veſſels of wrath prepared to deſtruction: and that he might declare the riches of his glory vpon the veſſels of mercy, which hee hath prepared vnto glorie?*

The meanes of accompliſhing Gods Predeſtination are two fold.

The creation, and the fall.

The creation, is that by which GOD made all things very good, of nothing; that is, of no matter which was before the creation. Gen. 1. 1. *In the beginning God created the heauen, &c.* to the end of the chapter.

Gods manner of creating, as alſo of gouerning, is ſuch, as that by his word alone, hee without any inſtruments, means, aſsiſtance, or motion, produced all ſorts of things: For to will any thing with God, is both to be able and to performe it. Heb. 11. 3. *By faith we vnderſtand, that the world was ordained by the word of God, ſo that the things which we ſee, are not made of things which did appeare.* Pſal. 148. 5. *Let them praiſe the name of the Lord, for he commanded, and they were created.*

The goodneſſe of the creature, is a kinde of excellencie, by which it was voide of all defect, whether puniſhment or fault.

The creation, is of the world, or inhabitants in the world.

The world, is a moſt beautifull pallace, framed out of a deformed ſubſtance, and fit to be inhabited.

The parts of the world, are the heauens and earth.

The heauens are three fold: the firſt is the ayre, the ſecond the skie, the third an inuiſible and incorporall eſſence, created to be the ſeat of all the bleſſed, both men, and angels. This third heauen is called Paradiſe. 2. Cor. 12. 4.

The inhabiters of the world, are reaſonable creatures, made according to Gods owne Image; they are either angels or men. Gen. 1. 16. [^1] *Furthermore, God ſaid, Let vs make man in our owne image, according to our likeneſſe.* Iob 1. 6. *When the children of God came and ſtood before the Lord, Satan came alſo among them.*

The Image of God, is the goodneſſe of the reaſonable creature, reſembling God in holineſſe. Eph. 4. 24. *And put on the new man, which after God is created in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe.*
