# Of Sinne, and the fall of Angels.

The fall is a reuolting of the reaſonable creature from obedience to ſinne.

Sinne, is the corruption, or rather depriuation of the firſt integritie. More plainely, it is a falling or turning from God, binding the offendour by the courſe of Gods iuſtice, to vndergoe the puniſhment.

Heere a doube may bee mooued, whether ſinne be a thing exiſting or not. The anſwer is this: Of things which are, ſome are poſitiue, other priuatiue. Things poſitiue, are all ſubſtances, together with thoſe their properties, powers, inclinations & affections, which the Lord hath created and imprinted in their natures. The thing is called priuatiue, which granteth or preſuppoſeth the abſence of ſome ſuch thing, as ought to be in a thing. Such a thing is ſinne, which properly, and of it ſelfe is not any thing created, and exiſting; but rather the abſence of that good which ought to bee in the creature: and though it be inherent in things poſitiue as a priuation, yet it is alwaies to be diſtinguiſhed from them.

Sinne hath two parts: A defect, or impotency: and diſorder.

Impotencie is nothing elſe, but the very want or loſſe of that good, which God hath ingrafted in the nature of his creature.

Diſorder, is the confuſion or diſturbance of all the powers and actions of the creature.

The fall was effected on this manner. Firſt, God created his reaſonable creatures good indeede, but withall changeable, as we haue ſhewed before. For to be vnchangeably good, is proper to God alone. Secondly, God tryed their obedience in thoſe things about which they were conuerſant. Deut. 13. 3. *Thou ſhalt not hearken to the words of that Prophet, or vnto that dreamer of dreames: for the Lord your God prooueth you, to know whether you loue the Lord your God, with all your heart, and with all your ſoule.* Thirdly in this triall God doth not aſsiſt them with new grace to ſtand, but for iuſt cauſes forſaketh them. Laſtly, after God hath forſaken them, and left them to themſelues, they fall quite from God: no otherwiſe, then when a man ſtaying vp a ſtaffe on the ground, it ſtandeth vpright; but if hee neuer ſo little withdraw his hand, it falleth of it ſelfe.

The fall, is of men, and Angels.

The fall of Angels, is that by which the vnderſtanding, pointing out a more excellent eſtate, and of it owne accord approouing thereof, and the will chooſing the ſame as pleaſing vnto it (their nature in the meane while remaining fit to make choice either of the contrary, or of diuers obiect) they are the ſole authors of their fall from God. 2. Pet. 2. 4. *If God ſpared not the Angels which ſinned, but caſt them downe into hell, and deliuered them into chaines of darkeneſſe, to bee kept vnto damnation, & c.* Iud. 6. *The Angels which kept not their firſt eſtate, but left their owne habitation, he hath reſerued in euerlaſting chaines, &c.* Ioh. 8. 44. *He was a murtherer from the beginning, and continued not in the truth: for there is no truth in him.*

In the fall of Angels, conſider: Firſt their corruption, ariſing from the fall; which is the deprauation of their nature, and is either that fearefull malice and hatred, by which they ſet themſelues againſt God, or their inſatiable deſire to deſtroy mankinde; to the effecting wherof, they neglect neither force nor fraud. 1. Ioh. 3. 8. *He that committeth ſinne is of the diuell, becauſe the diuell ſinned from the beginning. For this cauſe was the Sonne of God reuealed, to diſſolue the workes of the diuell.* 1. Pet. 5. 8. *Your aduerſary the diuell goeth about like a roaring lyon, ſeeking whom he may deuoure.* Eph. 6. 12. *You ſtriue not againſt fleſh and blood, but againſt principalities and powers, and worldly gouernors; the princes of darknes of this world, againſt ſpirituall wickedneſſes, which are in ſuperceleſtiall things.*

II. Their degree, and diuerſitie: for of theſe Angels, one is chiefe, and the reſt attendants. The chiefe is Beelzebub, prince of the reſt of the diuels, and the world, farre aboue them all in malice. Mat. 25. 41. *Away from me ye curſed into euerlaſting fire, prepared for the diuell and his Angels.* 2. Cor. 4. 4. *Whoſe minds the god of this world hath blinded.* Reuel. 12. 7. *And there was war in heauen, Michael, and his Angels fought with the dragon, and the dragon and his Angels fought.*

Miniſtring Angels, are ſuch as waite vpon the diuell, in accompliſhing his wickedneſſe.

III. Their puniſhment. God, after their fall, gaue them ouer to perpetuall torments, without any hope of pardon. *Iude,* verſe 6. 2. *Pet*. 2. 4. *God ſpared not the Angels that had ſinned, but caſt them downe into hel, and deliuered them into chaines of darknes, to be kept vnto damnation.* This he did: Firſt, to admoniſh men, what great puniſhment they deſerued. Secondly, to shew that grieuous ſins muſt more grieuouſly be puniſhed.

The fall of Angels was the more grieuous, becauſe both their nature was more able to reſiſt, & the diuel was the firſt founder of ſin.

Their puniſhment is eaſier, or more grieuous.

Their eaſier puniſhment is double. The firſt, is their deiection from heauen. 2. *Pet.* 2. 4. *God caſt the Angels that ſinned into hell.* The ſecond, is the abridging and limitation of their power, *Iob.* 1. 12. *The Lord ſaid vnto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thine hand, onely vpon him lay not thine hand.*

The more grieuous paine, is that torment in the deepe, which is endleſſe and infinite, in time and meaſure. *Luke* 8. 31. *And they beſought him, that he would not command them to goe downe into the deepe.*
