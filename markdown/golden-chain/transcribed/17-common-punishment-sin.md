# Of the common puniſhment of ſinne.

HItherto wee haue intreated of ſinne, wherewith all mankinde is infected: in the next place ſucceedeth the puniſhment of ſinne, which is threefolde. The firſt is in this life, and that diuers waies. The firſt concerneth the bodie, eyther in the prouiſion with trouble for the things of this life, Gen. 3. 17. or a proneneſſe to diſeaſes, Math. 9. 2. *Sonne, be of good comfort, thy ſinnes be forgiuen thee.* *Ioh.* 5. 14. *Behold, thou art made whole, ſin no more, leſt a worſe thing fal vpon thee.* Deut. 28. 21, 22. *The Lord ſhall make the peſtilence cleaue vnto thee, vntil he hath conſumed thee from the land, &c.* Or ſhame of nakednes. Gen. 3. 7. Or in womens paines in child-birth, Gen. 3. 16. *Vnto the woman he ſaid, I will greatly increaſe thy ſorrowes, and conceptions: in ſorrow ſhalt thou bring forth children.*

II. The ſoule is puniſhed with trembling of conſcience, care, trouble, hardnes of heart, and madnes. Deut. 28. 28. *The Lord ſhall ſmite thee with madneſſe, and with blindneſſe, and with a ſtonying of heart.*

III. The whole man is puniſhed. 1. with fearefull ſubiection to the regiment of Satan. Coloſſ. 1. 13. *Which freed vs from the power of darkeneſſe, and tranſlated vs into the kingdome of his beloued Sonne,* Hebrewes 2. 14. *Hee alſo himſelfe tooke part with them, that he might deſtroy through death, him that had power of death, that is the diuell.* 2. A ſeparation from the fellowſhip of God, and trembling at his preſence. Eph. 4. 18. *Hauing their cogitation darkened, and beeing ſtrangers from the life of God.* Gen. 3. 10. *I heard thy voice in the garden, and was afraid, becauſe I was naked, therefore I hid my ſelfe.*

IV. Vpon a mans goods, diuers calamities and dammages. Deut. 28, 29. *Thou ſhalt euer be oppreſſed with wrong, & be pouled, and no man ſhall ſuccour thee, &c.* to the end of the chapter. To this place may be referred diſtinction of Lordſhips: and of this commeth a care to inlarge them, and bargaining with all manner of ciuill ſeruitudes.

V. The loſſe of that Lordly authority, which man had ouer all creatures; alſo their vanity, which is not onely a weakning, but alſo a corrupting of that excellency of the vertues and powers which God at the firſt put into them. Rom. 8. 20, 21. *The creature is ſubiect to vanity, not of it owne will, but by reaſon of him, which hath ſubdued it vnder hope, &c.*

VI. In a mans name, infamie and ignominie ſometimes after his death. *Ier.* 24. 6.

The ſecond, is at the laſt gaſpe, namely, death, or a change like vnto death. Rom. 6. 23. *The wages of ſinne is death.*

The third is, after this life, euen eternal deſtruction from Gods preſence, and his exceeding glory. 2. Theſſ. 1. 9. *Who ſhall bee puniſhed with euerlaſting perdition from the preſence of God, and the glory of his power.*
