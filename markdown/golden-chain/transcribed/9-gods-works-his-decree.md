# Of Gods workes, and his decree.

THus far concerning the firſt part of Theologie: the ſecond followeth, of the workes of God.

The workes of God, are all thoſe, which he doth out of himſelfe, that is, out of his diuine eſſence.

Theſe are common to the Trinitie, the peculiar manner of working alwaies reſerued to euery perſon.

The end of al theſe, is the manifeſtation of the glory of God. Rom. 11. 36. *For him are all things, to him be glory for euer.*

The worke, or action of God, is eyther his decree, or the execution of his decree.

The decree of God, is that by which God in himſelfe, hath neceſſarily, and yet freely, from al eternity determined al things. *Eph.* 1. 11. *In whom alſo we are choſen, when we were predeſtinate, according to the purpoſe of him, which worketh all things after the counſell of his owne will.* and v. 4. *As he hath choſen vs in him before the foundation of the world.* Math. 10. 29. *Are not two ſparrowes ſold for a farthing, and not one of them falleth on the ground without your Father?* Rom. 9. 21. *Hath not the potter power on the clay to make of the ſame lumpe one veſſell to diſhonour, and another to honour.*

Therefore the Lord, according to his good pleaſure, hath moſt certainely decreed euery thing and action, whether paſt, preſent, or to come, together with their circumſtances of place, time, meanes, and end.

Yea, he hath moſt iuſtly decreed the wicked works of the wicked. For if he had nilled thé, they ſhould neuer haue been at all. And albeit they of their owne nature, are and remaine wicked; yet in reſpect of Gods decree, they are ſome waies good: for there is not any thing abſolutely euill. 1. Pet. 3. 17. *For it is better (if the will of God be ſo) that ye ſuffer for well doing, then for euill doing.*

The thing which in it owne nature is euill, in Gods eternall counſell is reſpectiuely good, in that it is ſome occaſion & way to manifeſt the glory of God in his iuſtice, and his mercy.

Gods foreknowledge, is conioyned with his decree, and indeed is in nature before it: yet not in regard of God, but vs: becauſe knowledge goeth before the will and the effecting of a work. For we do nothing, but thoſe things that we haue before willed, neither doe we will any thing which we know not before.

Gods foreknowledge in it ſelfe, is not a cauſe why things are, but as it is conioyned with his decree. For things doe not therefore come to paſſe, becauſe that God did foreknow them: but becauſe hee decreede and willed them, therefore they come to paſſe.

The execution of Gods decree is that, by which all things in their time are accompliſhed which were foreknowne or decreed, and that euen as they were foreknown & decreed.

The ſame decree of GOD, is the firſt and principall working cauſe of all things, which alſo is in order, and time before all other cauſes. For with Gods decree is alwaies his will annexed, by the which he can will that which he hath decreed. And it were a ſigne of impotency, to decree any thing which he could not will. And with Gods will is conioyned an effectuall power, by which the Lord can bring to paſſe, whatſoeuer he hath freely decreed.

The firſt and principall cauſe, howbeit in it ſelfe it be neceſſary, yet it doth not take away freedome of wil in election; or the nature and property of ſecond cauſes; but onely brings them into a certain order; that is, it directeth them to the determinate end, whereupon the effects and euents of things are contingent or neceſſarie, as the nature of the ſecond cauſe is. So Chriſt according to his Fathers decree died neceſſarily, *Act.* 17. 3. but yet willingly, *Ioh.* 10. 18. *Mat.* 26. 53. And if we reſpect the temperature of Chriſts body, he might haue prolonged his life; and therefore in this reſpect may be ſaid to haue dyed contingently.

The execution of Gods decree, hath two branches; his operation, and his operatiue permiſsion.

Gods operation, is his effectuall producing of all good things, which either haue being or moouing, or which are done.

Gods operatiue permiſsion, is that by which he onely permitteth one and the ſame worke to be done of others, as it is euill; but as it is good, he effectually worketh the ſame. Gen. 50. 20. *You indeed had purpoſed euill againſt me, but God decreed that for good, that he might, as he hath done this day, preſerue his people aliue.* And, Gen. 45. 7. *God hath ſent me before you to preſerue your poſterity un this land.* Eſa. 10. 5, 6, 7. *Woe vnto Asſhur, the rod of my wrath, and the ſtaffe in their hands in mine indignation, I will giue him a charge againſt the people of my wrath to take the ſpoile, and to take the prey, and to tread them vnder feete like the myre in the ſtreete. But he thinketh not ſo, neither doth his heart eſteeme it ſo: but he imagineth to deſtroy, and to cut off not a few nations.*

God permitteth euill, by a certaine voluntary permiſsion, in that he forſaketh the ſecond cauſe in working euill. And he forſaketh his creature, either by detracting the grace it had, or not beſtowing that which it wanteth. Rom. 1. 26. *For this cauſe God gaue them vp vnto vile affections.* 2. Tim. 2. 25, 26. *Inſtructing them with meekeneſſe that are contrary minded, proouing if God at anytime will giue repentance, that they may know the truth; and that they may come to amendment out of the ſnare of the diuell, which are taken of him at his will.*

Neither muſt we thinke God herein vniuſt, who is indebted to none. Rom. 9. 15. *I will haue mercy on him to whom I will ſhew mercy,* Yea it is in Gods pleaſure to beſtow how much grace, and vpon whom he will. Matth. 20. 15. *Is it not lawfull for me to doe as I will with mine owne?*

That which is euill, hath ſome reſpect of goodneſſe with God: Firſt, in that it is the puniſhment of ſinne: and puniſhment is accounted a morall good, in that it is the part of a iuſt iudge to puniſh ſinne. Secondly, as it is a meere actió or act. Thirdly, as it is a chaſtiſement, a triall of ones faith, martyrdome, propitiation for ſin, as the death and paſsion of Chriſt. *Act.* 2. 23. and 4. 24. And if we obſerue theſe caueats, God is not onely a bare permiſſiue agent in an euill worke, but a powerfull effectour of the ſame; yet ſo, as he neither inſtilleth an abberation in the action, nor yet ſupporteth, or intendeth the ſame, but that he moſt freely ſuffereth euill, and beſt diſpoſeth of it to his owne glory. The like we may ſee in this ſimilitude: Let a man ſpurre forward a lame horſe; in that he mooueth forward, the rider is the cauſe; but that he halteth, he himſelfe is the cauſe. And againe, we ſee the ſunne beames ſhining through a glaſſe; where the light is from the Sunne, the colour not from the Sunne but from the glaſſe.
