# Concerning the perſons of the Godhead.

THe perſons are they, which ſubſiſting in one Godhead, are diſtinguiſhed by incommunicable properties. 1 Ioh. 5. 7. *There are three that beare record in heauen, the Father, the Word, and the holy Ghoſt, and theſe three are one.* Gen. 19. 24. *Then Iehouah rained vpon Sodome, and vpon Gomorah, brimſtone, & fire from Iehouah in heauen.* Ioh. 1. 1. *In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and that Word was God.*

They therefore are coequall, and are diſtinguiſhed not by degree, but by order.

The Conſtitution of a perſon is, when as a perſonall propertie, or the proper manner of ſubſiſting is adioined to the Deity, or the one diuine nature,

Diſtinction of perſons, is that, by which albeit euery perſon is one and the ſame perfect God, yet the Father is not the Sonne or the holy Ghoſt, but the Father alone; and the Sonne is not the Father or the holy Ghoſt, but the Sonne alone; and the H. Ghoſt is not the Father or the Sonne, but the holy Ghoſt alone: neither can they be diuided, by reaſon of the infinite greatneſſe of that moſt ſimple eſſence, which one and the ſame, is wholly in the Father, wholly in the Sonne, and wholly in the holy Ghoſt: ſo that in theſe there is diuerſitie of perſons, but vnitie in eſſence.

The communion of the perſons, or rather vnion, is that by which each one is in the reſt, and with the reſt, by reaſon of the vnity of the Godhead: and therefore euery each one doth poſſeſſe, loue, and glorifie another, and worke the ſame thing. Ioh. 14. 10. *Beleeueſt thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me? the word that I ſpeake vnto you I ſpeake not of my ſelfe, but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doth the workes,* Prou. 8. 22. *The Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way: I was before the workes of old.* And v. 30. *Then was I with him as a nouriſher, and I was daily his delight, reioycing alway before him.* Ioh. 1. 1. *In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and that Word was God,* and cap. 5. 19. *The Sonne can doe nothing of himſelfe, ſaue that he ſeeth the Father doe: for whatſoeuer things he doth, the ſame doth the Sonne alſo.*

There be three perſons: the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt. Matth. 3. 16, 17. *And Ieſus, when he was baptized, came ſtraight out of the water, and loe, the heauens were opened vnto him, and Iohn ſaw the Spirit of God deſcending like a doue, and lighting vpon him: and loe, a voice came from heauen, ſaying, This is my beloued Sonne, in whom I am well pleaſed.*

The Father, is a perſon without beginning, from all eternity begetting the Sonne, Heb. 1. 3. *Who being the brightneſſe of the glory, and the ingraued forme of his perſon.* Pſal. 2. 7. *Thou art my Sonne, this day haue I begotten thee.*

In the generation of the Sonne, theſe properties muſt be noted: I. He that begetteth, and he that is begotten are together, and not one before another in time. II. He that begetteth, doth communicate with him that is begotten, not ſome one part, but his whole eſſence. III. The Father begot the Sonne, not out of himſelfe, but within himſelfe.

The incommunicable property of the Father, is to be vnbegotten, to be a Father, and to beget. He is the beginning of actions, becauſe he beginneth euery action of himſelfe, effecting it by the Sonne and the holy Ghoſt. 1. Cor. 8. 6. *Yet vnto vs, there is but one God, which is the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him, & one Lord Ieſus Chriſt, by whom are all things, and we by him.* Rom. 11. 36. *For of him, and through him, and for him, are all things.*

The other two perſons haue the Godhead, or the whole diuine eſſence, of the Father by communication, namely, the Sonne and the holy Ghoſt.

The Sonne is the ſecond perſon, begotten of the Father from all eternitie. Heb. 1. 5. *For vnto which of the Angels ſaid hee at any time, Thou art my Sonne, this day begate I thee?* Col. 1. 15. *Who is the image of the inuiſible God, the firſt borne of euery creature.* Ioh. 1. 14. *And we ſaw the glory thereof, as the glory of the onely begotten Sonne of the Father,* Rom. 8. 32. *He who ſpared not his owne Sonne.*

Although the Sonne be begotten of his Father, yet neuertheleſſe he is of and by himſelfe very God: for he muſt be conſidered either according to his eſſence, or according to his filiation or Sonſhip. In regard of his eſſence, hee is (ɑυτοθɛος) [^1] that is, of and by himſelf very God: for the Deitie which is common to all the three perſons, is not begotten. But as he is a perſon, and the Sonne of the Father, hee is not of himſelfe, but from another: for he is the eternall Sonne of his Father. And thus he is truly ſaid to be *very God of very God.*

For this cauſe he is ſaid to be ſent from the Father, Ioh. 8. 42. *I proceeded forth, and came from God, neither came I of my ſelfe, but he ſent mee.* This ſending taketh not away the equality of eſſence, and power, but declareth the order of the perſons, Ioh. 5. 18. *Therefore the Iewes ſought the more to kil him, not onely becauſe he had broken the Sabbath: but ſaid alſo that God was his Father, and made himſelfe equall with God.* Phil. 2. 6. *Who being in the forme of God, thought it no robbery to be equall with God.*

For this cauſe alſo he is *the WORD of the Father,* not a vaniſhing, but eſſentiall word, becauſe as a word is, as it were, begotten of the mind, ſo is the Sonne begotten of the Father; & alſo, becauſe he bringeth glad tidings from the boſome of his Father. *Nazian.* in his Oration of the Sonne. *Baſill* in his preface before *Iohns* Goſpell.

The property of the Sonne, is to bee begotten.

His proper manner of working, is to execute actions from the Father, by the holy Ghoſt. 1. Cor. 8. 6. *Our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, by whom are all things, and we by him.* Ioh. 5. 19. *Whatſoeuer things he doth, the ſame doth the Son alſo.*

The holy Ghoſt, is the third perſon, proceeding from the Father and the Sonne. Ioh. 15. 26. *But when the Comforter ſhal come, whom I will ſend vnto you from the Father, euen the ſpirit of truth, which proceedeth of the Father, hee ſhall teſtifie of me.* Rom. 8. 9. *But yee are not in the fleſh, but in the ſpirit, ſeeing the ſpirit of God dwelleth in you. But if there be any that hath not the ſpirit of Chriſt he is not his.* Ioh. 16. 13, 14. *But when the Spirit of truth ſhall come: hee ſhall conduct you into all truth: for he ſhall not ſpeake of himſelfe, but whatſoeuer he heareth, hee ſhall ſpeake, and ſhall declare vnto you ſuch things as are to come. He shall glorifie me, for he ſhall receiue of mine, and ſhew it vnto you.*

And albeit the Father, and the Sonne are two diſtinct perſons, yet are they both but one beginning of the holy Ghoſt.

What may be the eſſentiall difference betwixt proceeding, and begetting, neither the Scriptures determine, nor the Church knoweth.

The incommunicable property of the holy Ghoſt, is to proceede.

His proper manner of working is, to finiſh an action, effecting it, as from the Father and the Sonne.
