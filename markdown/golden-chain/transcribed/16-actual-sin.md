# Of actuall ſinne.

AFter Original ſinne in *Adams* poſterity, actuall tranſgreſsion taketh place. It is either inward or outward: Inward, is of the minde, will, and affections.

The actuall ſinne of the minde is the euill thought or intent thereof, contrary to Gods law. Examples of euill thoughts, God (the only knower of the heart) hath in diuers places ſet downe in his word. I. That there is no God. Pſal. 10. 4. *The wicked is ſo proud, that he ſeeketh not for God, he thinketh alwaies there is no God.* Pſal. 14. 1. *The foole ſaith in his heart, there is no God.* II. That there is neither prouidence nor preſence of God in this world. Pſal. 10. 11. *He ſaith in his heart, God hath forgotten: hee hideth away his face and will neuer ſee,* verſe 13. *Wherfore doth the wicked contemne God? he ſaith in his heart, thou wilt not regard.* III. It imagineth ſafegard to it ſelfe from all perils. Pſal. 10. 6. *He ſaith in his heart, I ſhall neuer be mooued nor be in danger.* Reu. 18. 7. *She ſaith in her heart, I ſit being a Queene, and am no widow, and ſhall ſee no mourning.* IV. It eſteemeth it ſelfe more excellent then other. Apoc. 18. 7. *I ſit as a Queene.* Luk. 18. 11. *The Phariſie ſtanding thus prayed to himſelfe, I thank thee, O God, that I am not as other men, extortioners, vniuſt, adulterers, not yet as this Publican.* v. 12. *I faſt twice in the weeke, and giue tyth of all my poſſeſſions.* V. That the Goſpell of Gods kingdome is meere fooliſhnes. 1. Cor. 2. 14. *The naturall man perceiueth not the things of the ſpirit of God, for they are fooliſhnes vnto him.* VI. To thinke vncharitably and maliciouſly of ſuch as ſerue God ſincerely. Mat. 12. 24. *When the Phariſies heard that, they ſaid, he caſteth not out diuels, but by the prince of diuels.* Pſ. 74. 8. *They ſaid in their hearts, Let vs deſtroy them altogether.* VII. To thinke the day of death farre off. Eſa. 28. 15. *Ye haue ſaid, we haue made a couenát with death, and with hell wee are at agreement, though a ſcourge run ouer vs, and paſſe through, it ſhall not come at vs.* VIII. That the paines of hell may be eſchewed: in the place before mentioned, they ſay, *With hell haue we made agreement.* IX. That God will deferre his both particular and laſt generall comming to iudgement. Luk. 12. 19. *I will ſay vnto my ſoule, Soule thou haſt much goods laid vp for many yeares.* and v. 45. *If that ſeruant ſay in his heart, My maſter will deferre his comming, &c.*

Many carnall men pretend their good meaning: but when God openeth their eyes, they ſhall ſee theſe rebellious thoughts riſing in their mindes, as ſparkles out of a chimney.

The actuall ſinne of both will and affection, is euery wicked motion, inclination, and deſire. Galat. 5. 17. *The fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit.*

An actuall outward ſin, is that, to the committing whereof, the members of the body, doe, together with the faculties of the ſoule, concurre. Such ſins as theſe are infinite. Pſal. 40. 12. *Innumerable troubles haue compaſſed me, my ſinnes haue taken ſuch hold on me, that I am not able to looke vp, yea, they are more in number than the haires of my head.*

Actual ſinne, is of omiſsion or commiſsion. Againe, both theſe are in words or deedes.

In the ſinne of commiſsion, obſerue theſe two points: the degrees in committing a ſin, and the difference of ſinnes committed.

The degrees, are in number foure. Iam. 1. 14, 15. *Euery man is tempted, when he is drawne away by his own concupiſcence, & is enticed: then when luſt hath conceiued, it bringeth forth ſinne; and ſin when it is finiſhed, bringeth forth death.*

The firſt degree, is temptation, whereby man is allured to ſinne. This doth Satan by offering to the mind that which is euill. *Ioh.* 13. 2. *The diuell had now put into the heart of Iudas Iscariot, Simons ſon to betray him.* Act. 5. 3. *Peter ſaid to Ananias, Why hath Satan filled thine heart that thou ſhouldeſt lye, &c.* 1. Chro. 21. 1. *And Satan ſtood vp againſt Iſrael, and prouoked Dauid to number Iſrael.* This is alſo effected vpon occaſion of ſome externall obiect, which the ſenſes perceiue. *Iob.* 31. 1. *I haue made a couenant with mine eyes, why then ſhould I looke vpon a maide?*

Tentation hath two parts: abſtraction, and ineſcation.

Abſtraction, is the firſt cogitation of committing ſin, whereby the mind is withdrawne from Gods ſeruice, to the which it ſhould be alwaies ready preſt. *Luk.* 10. 27. *Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and all thy ſoule, with all thy thought.*

Ineſcation, is that whereby an euil thought conceiued, and for a time retained in the mind by delighting the will and affections, doth as it were, lay a baite for them to draw them to conſent.

The ſecond degree, is conception, which is nothing els but a conſent and reſolution to commit ſinne. Pſal. 7. 14. *He ſhall trauell with wickedneſſe, he hath conceiued miſchiefe, but hee ſhall bring forth a lye.*

The third degree, is the birth of ſinne, namely, the committing of ſinne, by the aſsiſtance both of the faculties of the ſoule, and the powers of the body.

The fourth degree, is perfection, when ſin being by cuſtome perfect, and as it were ripe, the ſinner reapeth death, that is, damnation.

This appeareth in the example of *Pharaoh:* wherefore cuſtome in any ſinne is fearefull.

Sinne actually committed, hath fiue differences.

Firſt, to conſent with an offendour, and not actually to commit ſinne. Eph. 5. 11. *Haue no fellowſhip with the vnfruitfull works of darknes, but reproue them rather.* This is done three manner of waies.

I. When a man in iudgement ſomewhat alloweth the ſinne of another. Numb. 20. 10. *Moſes & Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and Moſes ſaid vnto them, Heare now ye rebels: ſhall we bring you water out of the rocke?* verſe 12. *The Lord ſpake to Moſes & Aaron, becauſe ye beleeued me not, to ſanctifie me in the preſence of the childing of Iſrael, therefore ye ſhall not bring the congregation into the land which I haue giuen them.*

II. When the heart approoueth in affection and conſent. Hither may wee referre both the Miniſters and the Magiſtrates concealing and winking at offences. 1. Sam. 2. 23. *Eli ſaid, Why do ye ſuch things? for of all this people I heare euill of you. Doe no more my ſons, &c.* Now that Elies will agreeth with his ſonnes ſinnes, it is manifeſt, ver. 29. *Thou honoureſt thy children aboue me.*

III. In deede; by counſell, preſence, inticement. Rom. 1. 31. *They do not only doe the ſame, but alſo fauour them that doe them.* Mar. 6. 25, 26. *Shee ſaid vnto her mother, What ſhall I aske? and ſhe ſaid, Iohn Baptiſts head, &c.* Act. 22. 20. *When the blood of thy Martyr Steuen was ſhed, I alſo ſtood by, and conſented vnto his death, and kept the clothes of them that ſlue him.*

The ſecond difference, is to ſinne ignorantly, as when a man doth not expreſly and diſtinctly know whether that which hee doth, be a ſinne or not, or if he know it, doe not acknowledge and mark it. 1. Tim. 1. 13. *I was before a blaſphemer, and a perſecutor, and an oppreſſour: but I was receiued to mercy, for I did it ignorantly through vnbeliefe.* Numb. 35. 22, 23, 24. *If he puniſhed him vnaduiſedly, & not of hatred, or caſt vpon him any thing without laying of wait or any ſtone (whereby he might be ſlaine) and ſaw him not, or cauſed it to fall vpon him, and he dye, and was not his enemy, neither ſought him any harme: then the congregation ſhall iudge betweene the ſlayer, and the auenger of blood, according to theſe lawes.* 1. Cor. 4. 4. *I know nothing by my ſelfe, yet am I not thereby iuſtified.* Pſal. 19. 13. *Cleanſe me from my ſecret ſinnes.* [^1]

The third difference is to ſinne vpon knowledge, but yet of infirmity, as when a man fearing ſome imminent danger, or amazed at the horrour of death, doth againſt his knowledge deny that truth, which otherwiſe hee would acknowledge and embrace. Such was *Peters* fall, ariſing from the ouer-much raſhneſſe of the minde, mingled with ſome feare.

Thus men offend, when the fleſh, and inordinate deſires ſo ouer-rule the will and euery good endeauour, that they prouoke man to that, which he from his heart deteſteth. Rom. 7. 19. *I doe not the good thing which I would, but the euill which I would not, that doe I.*

The fourth difference, is preſumptuous ſinning vpon knowledge. Pſal. 19. 13. *Keepe thy ſeruant from preſumptuous ſinnes: let them not raigne ouer mee.* Hitherto belongeth. I. euery ſinne committed with an high hand, that is, in ſome contempt of God. Numb. 15. 30. *The perſon that doth preſumptuouſly, &c. ſhall bee cut off from amongſt his people: becauſe he hath deſpiſed the word of the Lord, and hath broken his commandement.* II. Preſumption of Gods mercy in doing euill. Eccleſ. 8. 11. *Becauſe ſentence againſt an euill worke is not executed ſpeedily, therefore the heart of the children of men is fully ſet in them to doe euill.* Rom. 2. 4. *Deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his bountifulneſſe, &c. not knowing that the bountifulnes of God leadeth thee to repentance.*

The fifth difference, is to ſinne vpon knowledge and ſet malice againſt God, and to this is the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt referred.
