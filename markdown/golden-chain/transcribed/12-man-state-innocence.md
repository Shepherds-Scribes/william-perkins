# Of man, and the eſtate of Innocencie.

MAn, after he was created of God, was ſet in an excellent eſtate of innocencie. In this eſtate ſeauen things are chiefly to bee regarded.

I. The place. The garden of Heden, that moſt pleaſant garden. Gen. 2. 15. *Then the Lord tooke the man, and put him into the garden of Heden.*

II. The integrity of mans nature. Which was, Eph. 4. 24. *created in righteouſnes and true holineſſe* This integrity hath two parts.

The firſt is wiſedome, which is a true and perfect knowledge of God, and of his will, in as much as it is to be performed of man; yea, and of the counſell of God in all his creatures. Col. 3. 10. *And haue put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge, after the image of him that created him.* Gen. 2. 19. *When the Lord God had formed on the earth euery beaſt of the field, and euery ſoule of the heauen, he brought them vnto the man, to ſee how he would cal them: for howſoeuer the man called the liuing creature, ſo was the name thereof.*

The ſecond is iuſtice, which is a conformitie of the will, affections, and powers of the body to doe the will of God.

III. Mans dignitie, conſiſting of foure parts. Firſt, his communion with God. By which, as God reioyced in his owne image, ſo likewiſe man did feruently loue God: this is apparent by Gods familiar conference with *Adam,* Gen. 1. 29. *And God ſaid, Behold, I haue giuen vnto you euery hearb bearing ſeede, &c. that ſhall be to you for meat.* Secondly, his dominion ouer all the creatures of the earth, Gen. 2. 19. Pſ. 8. 6. *Thou haſt made him Lord ouer the works of thine hands, & haſt ſet al things vnder his feet, &c.* Thirdly, the decency, and dignitie of the body, in which, though naked, as nothing was vnſeemly, ſo was there in it imprinted a princely maieſty, Pſal. 8. [^1] *Thou haſt made him litle lower then God, and crowned him with glory and worſhip.* Gen. 2. 25. *They were both naked, & neither aſhamed.* 1. Cor. 12. 23. *Vpon thoſe members of the body, which we thinke moſt vnhoneſt, put wee more honeſty on: and our vncomely parts haue more comlines on.* Fourthly, labour of the body without paine or griefe. Gen. 3. 17. 19. *Becauſe thou haſt obeyed the voice of thy wife, &c. curſed is the earth for thy ſake, in ſorrow ſhalt thou eate of it all the daies of thy life, &c.*

IV. Subiection to God, whereby man was bound to performe obedience to the commandement of God: which are two. The one was concerning the two trees: the other the obſeruation of the Sabbath.

Gods commaundement concerning the trees, was ordained to be a proofe and tryall of mans obedience. It conſiſteth of 2. parts: the firſt is the giuing of the tree of life, that as a ſigne, it might confirme to man his perpetuall abode in the garden of Heden, if ſtill hee perſiſted in his obedience, Reuel. 2. 7. *To him that ouercommeth, wil I giue to eate of the tree of life, which is in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God,* Pro. 3. 18. *She is a tree of life to them which lay hold on her: and bleſſed is he that retaineth her.*

The ſecond, is the prohibition to eate of the tree of the knowledge of good and euill, together with a commination of temporall and eternal death, if he tranſgreſſed this commandement. Gen. 2. 17. *Of the tree of the knowledge of good and euill, thou ſhalt not eate of it: for in the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt dye the death.* This was a ſigne of death, and had his name of the euent, becauſe the obſeruation thereof would haue brought perpetuall happines, as the violation gaue experience of euill, that is, of all miſerie, namely of puniſhment, and of guiltineſſe of ſinne.

Gods commandement concerning the obſeruation of the Sabbath, is that, by which God ordained the ſanctification of the Sabbath. Gen. 2. 3. *God bleſſed the ſeauenth day, and ſanctified it.*

V. His calling, which is the ſeruice of God, in the obſeruation of his commaundements, and the dreſsing of the garden of Heden. Prou. 16. 4. *God made all things for himſelfe.* Gen. 2. 15. *He placed him in the garden of Heden to dreſſe and keepe it.*

VI. His diet was the hearbs of the earth, and fruit of euery tree, except the tree of the knowledge of good and euill. Gen. 1. 29. *And God ſaid, behold, I haue giuen vnto you euery hearbe bearing ſeede, which is vpon all the earth, and euery tree, wherein is the fruit of a tree bearing ſeed, that ſhall be to you for meat.* And chap. 2. 17. *But of the tree of knowledge of good and euill, thou ſhalt not eate.*

VII. His free choice, both to will and performe the commaundement concerning the two trees, and alſo to neglect and violate the ſame. Whereby wee ſee that our firſt parents were indeed created perfect, but mutable: for ſo it pleaſed God to prepare a way to the execution of his decree.
