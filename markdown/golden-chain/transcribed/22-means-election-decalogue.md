# Concerning the outward meanes of executing the decree of Election, and of the Decalogue.

AFter the Foundation of Election, which hath hitherto beene deliuered, it followeth, that we ſhould intreate of the outward means of the ſame.

The meanes are Gods couenant, and the ſeale thereof.

Gods couenant, is his contract with man, concerning the obtaining of life eternall, vpon a certaine condition.

This couenant conſiſts of two parts: Gods promiſe to man, Mans promiſe to God.

Gods promiſe to man, is that, whereby he bindeth himſelfe to man to be his God, if he performe the condition.

Mans promiſe to God, is that, whereby he voweth his allegeance vnto his Lord, and to performe the condition betweene them.

Againe, there are two kindes of this couenant. The couenant of workes, and the couenant of grace. *Ieremie* 31, 31, 32, 33. *Beholde the dayes come, ſaith the Lord, that I will make a new couenant with the houſe of Iſrael, and with the houſe of Iudah, not according to the couenant, I made with their fathers, when I tooke them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; the which my couenant they brake, although I was an husband to them, ſaith the Lord. But this ſhal be the couenant, that I will make with the houſe of Iſrael: after thoſe daies, ſaith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they ſhall be my people.*

The couenant of workes, is Gods couenant, made with condition of perfect obedience, and is expreſſed in the morall law.

The Moral Law, is that part of Gods word which commaundeth perfect obedience vnto man, as well in his nature, as in his actions, and forbiddeth the contrarie. Romanes 10. 5. *Moſes thus deſcribeth the righteouſnes which is of the law, that the man, which doth thoſe things, ſhall liue thereby.* 1. Timothie 1. 5. *The ende of the commandement, is loue out of a pure heart, & of a good conſcience, and faith vnfained.* Luk. 16. 27. *Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God, with all thine heart, with all thy ſoule, and with all thy ſtrength.* Rom. 7. 14. *We know that the law is ſpirituall.*

The Law hath two parts. The Edict, commaunding obedience, and the condition binding to obedience. The condition is eternall life to ſuch as fulfill the law, but to tranſgreſſours, euerlaſting death.

The Decalogue, or ten commandements, is an abridgement of the whole law, and the couenant of workes. Exod. 34. 27. *And the Lord ſaid vnto Moſes, Write thou theſe words, for after the tenour of theſe words, I haue made a couenant with thee, and with Iſrael. And he was there with the Lord fourty daies and fourty nights, and did neither eate bread, nor drinke water, and he wrote in the tables the words of the couenant, euen the ten commandements.* 1. Kin. 8. 9. *Nothing was in the Arke, ſaue the two tables of ſtone, which Moſes had put there at Horeb, where the Lord made a couenant with the children of Iſrael, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.* Mat. 22. 40. *On theſe two cómandements hangeth the whole law and the prophets.*

The true interpretation of the Decalogue, muſt be according to theſe rules.

I. In the negatiue, the affirmatiue muſt be vnderſtood: and in the affirmatiue, the negatiue.

II. The negatiue bindeth at all times, and to all times: and the affirmatiue, bindeth at al times, but not to all times: and therfore negatiues are of more force.

III. Vnder one vice expreſly forbidden, are comprehended all of that kinde; yea the leaſt cauſe, occaſion, or enticement thereto, is forbidden; as 1. *Ioh.* 3. 15. *Whoſoeuer hateth his brother, is a man-ſlayer.* Math. 5. 21. to the end. Euill thoughts are condemned, as well as euill actions,

IV. The ſmalleſt ſinnes are entituled with the ſame names, that that ſinne is, which is expreſly forbidden in that commaundement, to which they appertaine. As in the former places, hatred is named murther, and to looke after a woman with a luſting eye, is adultery.

V. Wee muſt vnderſtand euery commandement of the law ſo, as that wee annexe this condition: *vnleſſe God command the contrary.* For God beeing an abſolute Lord, and ſo aboue the law, may command that which his law forbiddeth: ſo he commanded *Iſaac* to be offered, the Egyptians to be ſpoiled, the braſen Serpent to be erected, which was a figure of Chriſt, &c.

The Decalogue, is deſcribed in two tables.

The ſumme of the firſt table is that we loue God with our minde, memory, affections, and all our ſtrength. Math. 22. 37. *This is the firſt,* (to wit, in nature and order) *and great commandement* (namely, in excellency, and dignitie.)
