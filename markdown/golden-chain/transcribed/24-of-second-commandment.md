# Of the ſecond Commandement.

HItherto haue wee entreated of the firſt commaundement, teaching vs to entertaine in our hearts, and to make choice of one onely God. The other three of the firſt table, concerne that holy profeſsion, which we muſt make towards the ſame God. For firſt, it is neceſſary to make choice of the true God. Secondly, to make profeſsion of the ſame God.

In the profeſsion of God, we are to conſider the parts thereof, and the time appointed for this profeſsion.

The parts are two: The ſolemne worſhip of God, and the glorifying of him.

The ſecond commaundement then concerneth the manner of performing holy and ſolemne worſhip vnto God. The words of the commaundement are theſe:

*Thou ſhalt make thee no grauen image, neither any ſimilitude of things which are in heauen aboue, neither that are in the earth beneath, nor that are in the waters vnder the earth: thou ſhalt not bow downe to them, neither ſerue them, for I am the Lord thy God, a iealous God, viſiting the iniquity of the fathers, vpon the children, vpon the third generation, and vpon the fourth of them that hate me, & ſhew mercy vnto thouſands vpon them that loue me, and keep my commandements.*

## The Reſolution.

*Thou ſhalt not make.* This is the firſt part of the commandement, forbidding to make an idol: Now an idol is not onely a certaine repreſentation, and image of ſome fained god, but alſo of the true *Iehouah.* The which may be prooued againſt the Papiſts by theſe arguments. The firſt is, Deuteronom. 4. 15, 16. *Take therefore good heede vnto your ſelues: for ye ſaw no image in the day that the Lord ſpake vnto you in Horeb, out of the middeſt of the fire, that ye corrupt not your ſelues, and make you a grauen image or repreſentation of any figure: whether it be the likenes of male or female.* Out of the words vttered by *Moſes,* as reaſon may be framed thus:

*If ye ſaw no image (namely of God,) ye ſhall make none.*

*But ye ſaw no image, onely heard a voice.*

*Therefore ye ſhall make no image of God.*

The ſecond reaſon: That idolatry which the Iſraelites committed, the very ſame is prohibited in this commandement.

But the Iſraelites idolatry, was the worſhip of God in an image. Hoſ. 2. 16. *At that day, ſaith the Lord, thou ſhalt call me no more Baali, but ſhalt call me Eſhi.*

The golden calfe was an image of God: for when it was finiſhed, *Aaron* proclaimed that *to morrow ſhould be a feaſt to Iehouah.* Exodus, 32. 5. And the ſame calfe is tearmed an idoll, *Act.* 7. 41.

Therefore the worſhipping of God in an image, is here prohibited.

*Any grauen image.* Here the more ſpeciall is put for the more generall, namely, a grauen image, for all counterfeit meanes of Gods worſhip.

The firſt part of the commaundement is here illuſtrated by a double diſtribution. The firſt is drawne from the cauſes. *Thou ſhalt not make thee an idol, whether it be engrauen in wood or ſtone, or whether it be painted in a table.* The ſecond is taken from the place. *Thou ſhalt not make thee an idol of things in heauen, as ſtarres, and birds; or in the earth, as of man, woman, beaſt; or vnder the earth, as fiſhes.*

This place is ſo expounded by *Moſes,* *Deut.* 4. 14. to the 20. verſe.

*Thou ſhalt not bow downe to them.* This is the ſecond part of the commaundement, forbidding all men to fall downe before an idol. I. This word *Bow downe,* is againe the ſpeciall put for the generall: for in it is inhibited all fained worſhip of God.

*For I.* Theſe words are a confirmation of this commaundement, perſwading to obedience by foure reaſons.

*The Lord (which is ſtrong).* The firſt reaſon, God is ſtrong, and ſo able to reuenge idolatry, *Heb.* 10. 31.

*A iealous God.* This ſpeech is taken from the eſtate of wedlocke: for God is called the husband of his Church. Eſa. 5. 4, 5. Epheſ. 5. 26, 27. And our ſpirituall worſhip, is as it were, a certaine marriage of our ſoules, conſecrated vnto the Lord. *Ierem.* 2. 2. *I remember thee with the kindnes of thy youth, and the loue of the marriage, when thou wenteſt after me in the wildernes, in a land that was not ſowne.* Whence alſo Idols are rightly called Gods corrivals. Heere is another argument drawne from a compariſon of things that be like. Gods people muſt alone worſhip him, becauſe they are linked to him, as a wife to her husband, vnto whom alone ſhe is bound: Therefore if his people forſake him, and betroth themſelues vnto idols, hee will vndoubtedly giue them a bill of diuorcement, and they ſhall be no more eſpouſed vnto him.
