# Of the diſtinction of both Natures.

THe diſtinction of both natures, is that, whereby they, with their properties and operations, remaine diſtinct without compoſition, mingling, or conuerſion, Ioh. 10. 17, 18. *Therefore doth my Father loue me, becauſe I lay downe my life, that I may take it againe. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it downe of my ſelfe, I haue power to lay it down, and haue power to take it againe.* Ioh. 13. 31, 32. *Now is the Sonne of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. If God be glorified in him, God ſhall alſo glorifie him in himſelfe.* Here we may obſerue, that there is one will in Chriſt as God; another, as man. Math. 26. 39. *Not as I will, but as thou wilt.* This alſo approoueth the ſentence of the Chalcedon Creede. *We confeſſe, that one and the ſame Chriſt Ieſus, both Sonne, Lord, onely begotten, is knowne and preached to bee in two natures without confuſion, mutation, diſtinction, or ſeparation.*

Laſtly, hereby it is manifeſt, that Chriſt, when hee became that which hee was not (namely man) continued ſtill that which hee was (very God.)
