<p>HItherto we haue ſpoken of the perfection of Gods nature: Now followeth the life of GOD, by which the Diuine Nature is in perpetuall action, liuing, and moouing in it ſelfe. Pſal. 42. 2. <em>My ſoule thirſteth for God, euen for the liuing God, when ſhall I come and appeare before the preſence of God?</em> Heb. 3. 12. <em>See there be not at any time in any of you an euill heart to depart from the liuing God.</em></p>
<p>The diuine Nature, is eſpecially in perpetuall operation by three attributes, the which doe manifeſt the operation of God towards his creatures. Theſe are his Wiſedome, Will, and Omnipotencie.</p>
<p>The wiſedome or knowledge of God, is that by the which God doth, not by certaine notions abſtracted from the things themſelues, but by his owne eſſence: nor ſucceſsiuely and by diſcourſe of reaſon, but by one eternall and immutable act of vnderſtanding, diſtinctly and perfectly know himſelfe, and all other things, though infinite, whether they haue bin or not. Math. 11. 27. <em>No man knoweth the Sonne but the Father, nor the Father but the Sonne, and he to whom the Sonne will reueale him.</em> Heb. 4. 13. <em>There is nothing created, which is not manifeſt in his ſight: but all things are naked and open to his eyes, with whom we haue to do,</em> Pſal. 147:5. <em>His wiſedome is infinite.</em></p>
<p>Gods wiſedome hath theſe parts: his foreknowledge, and his counſell.</p>
<p>The foreknowledge of God, is that by which he moſt aſſuredly foreſeeth all things that are to come. Act. 2. 23. <em>Him haue ye taken by the hands of the wicked, being deliuered by the determinate counſell and foreknowledge of God, and haue crucified and ſlaine.</em> Rom. 8. 29. <em>Thoſe which he knew before, he alſo predeſtinated to be made like to the image of his Sonne.</em> This is not properly ſpoken of God, but by reaſon of men to whom things are paſt or to come.</p>
<p>The counſell of God, is that by the which he doth moſt rightly perceiue the beſt reaſon of all things that are done. Prou. 8. 14. <em>I haue counſell and wiſedome, I am vnderſtanding, and I haue ſtrength.</em></p>
<p>The will of God, is that by the which he both moſt freely, and iuſtly with one act willeth all things. Rom. 9. 18. <em>He hath mercie on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth.</em> Eph. 1. 5. <em>Who hath predeſtinate vs to be adopted through Ieſus Chriſt vnto himſelfe, according to the good pleaſure of his will.</em> Iam. 4. 15. <em>For that which you ſhould ſay, If the Lord will, and we liue we will doe this or that.</em></p>
<p>God willeth that which is good, by approuing it; that which is euill, in as much as it is euill, by diſallowing and forſaking it. And yet he voluntarily doth permit euill; becauſe it is good that there ſhould be euill. Act. 14. 16. <em>Who in time paſt ſuffered all the Gentiles to walke in their owne waies.</em> Pſal. 81. 12. <em>So I gaue them vp to the hardnes of their heart, and they haue walked in their owne counſels.</em></p>
<p>The will of God, by reaſon of diuers obiects, hath diuers Names, and is either called Loue and Hatred, or Grace and Iuſtice.</p>
<p>The Loue of God is that, by the which God approoueth firſt himſelfe, and then all his creatures as they are good, without their deſert, and in them doth take delight. 1. Ioh. 4. 16. <em>God is loue, and who ſo remaineth in loue, remaineth in God, and God in him.</em> Ioh. 3. 16. <em>So God loued the world, that he gaue his onely begotten Sonne, &amp;c.</em> Rom. 5. 8. <em>God ſetteth out his loue towards vs, ſeeing that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for vs.</em></p>
<p>The Hatred of God, is that by the which he diſliketh and deteſteth his creature offending, for his fault. 1 Cor. 10. 5. <em>But many of thé the Lord miſliked, for they periſhed in the wildernes.</em> Pſ. 5. 5. <em>Thou hateſt al the workers of iniquity.</em> Pſ. 45. 7. <em>Thou haſt loued iuſtice &amp; hated iniquity.</em></p>
<p>The grace of God, is that by which he freely declareth his fauour to his creatures. Rom. 11. 6. <em>If it be of grace, it is no more of workes: otherwiſe grace is not grace; but if it be of works it is no more grace.</em> Tit. 2. 11. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> <em>The ſauing grace of God ſhined to all men, teaching vs to deny impietie, &amp;c.</em></p>
<p>The Grace of God, is either his goodneſſe, or his mercie.</p>
<p>The Goodneſſe of God, is that by which he being in himſelfe abſolutely good, doth freely exerciſe his liberalitie vpon his creatures, Matth. 19. 17. <em>Why calleſt thou mee good? there is none good but one, euen God.</em> Math. 5. 45. <em>He maketh Sunne to ſhine vpon the good and bad, and he raineth vpon the iuſt and vniuſt.</em></p>
<p>Gods mercie, is that by which he freely aſſiſteth all his creatures in their miſeries. Eſa. 30. 18. <em>Yet will the Lord waite, that he may haue mercy vpon you.</em> Lam. 3. 22. <em>It is the Lords mercy that we are not conſumed, becauſe his compaſſions faile not.</em> Exod. 33. 19. <em>I take pitie on whom I take pitie, and am mercifull to whom I am mercifull.</em></p>
<p>Gods iuſtice, is that by which he in all things willeth that which is iuſt. Pſal. 11. 7. <em>The iuſt Lord loueth iuſtice.</em> Pſal. 5. 4. <em>For thou art not a God that loueth wickedneſſe.</em></p>
<p>Gods iuſtice is in word or deede.</p>
<p>Iuſtice in word, is that truth by which he conſtantly, and indeede willeth that which he hath ſaid. Rom. 3. 4. <em>Let God be true, and euery man a lyar.</em> Math. 24. 35. <em>Heauen and earth ſhall paſſe away, but my word ſhall not paſſe away.</em> Hence it is, that there is a certaine iuſtice of God in keeping his promiſe. 1. Ioh. 1. 9. <em>If we confeſſe our ſinnes, God is faithfull and iuſt to forgiue our ſinnes,</em> 2. Tim. 4. 8. <em>Henceforth is laid vp for mee the crowne of righteouſneſſe, which the Lord the righteous iudge ſhal giue me at that day</em></p>
<p>Iuſtice in deede, is that by which he either diſpoſeth or rewardeth.</p>
<p>Gods diſpoſing Iuſtice, is that by which he, as a moſt free Lord, ordereth rightly al things in his actions. Pſal. 145. 17. <em>The Lord is righteous in all his waies.</em></p>
<p>Gods rewarding Iuſtice, is that by which he rendreth to his creature according to his worke. 2. Theſſ. 1. 6. <em>It is iuſtice with God, to render affliction to ſuch as afflict you, but to you which are afflicted, releaſing with vs.</em> <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup> 1. Pet. 1. 17. <em>Therefore if you call him Father, which without reſpect of perſon iudgeth according to euery mans worke, paſſe the time of your dwelling here in feare.</em> Ierem. 51. 56. <em>The Lord that recompenſeth, ſhall ſurely recompence.</em></p>
<p>The Iuſtice of God, is either his Gentlenes or Anger.</p>
<p>Gods Gentleneſſe, is that by which he freely rewardeth the righteouſneſſe of his creature. 2. Theſ. 1. 5. <em>Which is a token of the righteous iudgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy the kingdome of God, for the which ye alſo ſuffer.</em> Mat. 10. 41, 42. <em>He that receiueth a Prophet, in the name of a Prophet: ſhall haue a Prophets reward: and he that receiueth a righteous man, in the name of a righteous man, ſhall haue the reward of a righteous man. And whoſoeuer ſhall giue vnto one of theſe little ones to drink a cup of cold water onely in the name of a Diſciple, verily I ſay vnto you, he ſhall not loſe his reward.</em></p>
<p>Gods Anger is that by which he willeth the puniſhment of the creature offending, Rom. 1. 18. <em>For the wrath of God is reuealed from heauen againſt all vngodlineſſe, and vnrighteouſneſſe of men, which withhold the truth in vnrighteouſneſſe.</em> Ioh. 3. 36. <em>He that obeyeth not the Sonne, ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</em></p>
<p>Thus much concerning the will of GOD; Now followeth his Omnipotencie.</p>
<p>Gods Omnipotencie, is that by which hee is moſt able to performe euery worke. Math. 19. 26. <em>With men this is impoſſible, but with God all things are poſſible.</em></p>
<p>Some things notwithſtanding are heere to be excepted. Firſt, thoſe things whoſe action argueth an impotencie, as to lie, to denie his word. Tit. 1. 2. <em>Which God, that cannot lie, hath promiſed.</em> 2. Tim. 2. 1. 3. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3">3</a></sup> <em>He cannot denie himſelfe.</em> Secondly, ſuch things as are contrary to the nature of God, as to deſtroy himſelfe, and not to beget his Sonne from eternity. Thirdly, ſuch things as imply contradiction. For God cannot make a truth falſe; or that which is when it is not, to be.</p>
<p>Gods power may be diſtinguiſhed into an abſolute and actuall power.</p>
<p>Gods abſolute power, is that by which he can doe more, then he either doth or will doe. Matth. 3. 9. <em>I ſay vnto you, God is able of theſe ſtones to raiſe vp children to Abraham.</em> Phil. 3. 21. <em>According to the working, whereby he is able to ſubdue euen all things to himſelfe.</em></p>
<p>Gods actuall power, is that by which hee cauſeth all things to be, which he freely willeth. Pſal. 135. 6. <em>Al things which God wil, thoſe he doth in heauen, and in earth, and in all depths.</em></p>
