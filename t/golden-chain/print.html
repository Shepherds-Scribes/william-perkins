<p>CHRISTIAN Reader, there are at this day foure ſeuerall opinions of the order of Gods Predeſtination. The firſt is, of the olde and new Pelagians; who place the cauſes of Gods Predeſtination in man; in that they holde, that God did ordaine men either to life or death, according as hee did fore-ſee, that they would by their naturall Free-will, eyther reiect or receiue grace offered. The ſecond of them, who (of ſome) are tearmed Lutherans; which teach, that God fore-ſeeing, how all mankinde being ſhut vp vnder beliefe, would therefore reiect grace offered, did hereupon purpoſe to chooſe ſome to ſaluation of his meere mercie, without any reſpect of their faith or good workes, and the reſt to reiect, beeing mooued to doe this, becauſe hee did eternally fore-ſee that they would reiect his grace offered them in the Goſpell. The third Semi-Pelagian Papiſts, which aſcribe Gods predeſtination, partly to mercy, and partly to mens fore-ſeene preparations and meritorious workes. The fourth, of ſuch as teach, that the cauſe of the execution of Gods predeſtination, is his mercy in Chriſt, in them which are ſaued; and in them which periſh, the fall and corruption of man: yet ſo, as that the decree and eternall counſell of God, concerning them both, hath not any cauſe beſides his will and pleaſure. Of theſe foure opinions, the three former I labour to oppugne, as erronious, and to maintaine the laſt, as being truth, which will beare weight in the ballance of the Sanctuary.</p>
<p>A further diſcourſe whereof, here I make bold to offer to thy godly conſideration: in reading whereof, regard not ſo much the thing it ſelfe penned very ſlenderly, as mine intent and affection: who deſire among the reſt, to caſt my mite into the treaſurie of the Church of <em>England</em>, and, for want of gold, pearle, and pretious ſtone, to bring a Rammes skinne or twaine, and a little Goates haire, to the building of the Lords tabernacle, <em>Exod.</em> 35. 23.</p>
<p>The Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt grant, that according to the riches of his glory, thou maiſt be ſtrengthened by his ſpirit in the inner man, that Chriſt may dwell in thy heart by faith; to the end that thou being rooted and grounded in loue, maieſt be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the breadth, and length, and height thereof; and to know the loue of Chriſt which paſſeth knowledge, that thou maieſt be filled with all fulneſſe of God. <em>Amen.</em> Farewell, <em>Iuly 23</em> the yeare of the laſt patience of Saints. 1592</p>

<p>THE Bodie of Scripture is a doctrine ſufficient to liue well.</p>
<p>It comprehendeth many holy ſciences, whereof one is principal, others are handmaids or retainers.</p>
<p>The principall ſcience is <em>Theologie</em>.</p>
<p><em>Theologie,</em> is the ſcience of liuing bleſſedly for euer. Bleſſed life ariſeth from the knowledge of God, Ioh. 17. 3. <em>This is life eternal, that they know thee to be the only very God, and whom thou haſt ſent Chriſt Ieſus.</em> Iſa. 53. 11. <em>By his knowledge ſhal my righteous ſeruant</em> (viz. Chriſt) <em>iuſtifie many.</em> And therefore it ariſeth likewiſe from the knowledge of our ſelues, becauſe we know God by looking into our ſelues.</p>
<p><em>Theologie</em> hath two parts: the firſt of God, the ſecond of his workes.</p>

<p>God is Iehouah Elohim, Exod. 6. 2, 3. <em>And Elohim ſpake vnto Moſes, and ſaid vnto him, I am Iehouah: and I appeared vnto Abraham, to Iſaac, and to Iacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name</em> Iehouah, <em>was I not knowne vnto them.</em> Exod. 3. 13. <em>If they ſay vnto me, what is his name?

And God ſpake further to Moſes, Thus ſhalt thou ſay vnto the children of Iſrael,</em> Iehouah Elohim, &amp;c. <em>hath ſent me vnto you.</em> <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> In theſe words, the firſt title of God, declareth his Nature, the ſecond his Perſons.</p>
<p>The nature of God, is his moſt liuely and moſt perfect eſſence.</p>
<p>The perfection of the nature of God, is the abſolute conſtitution thereof, whereby it is wholly complete within it ſelfe, Exod. 3. 13. <em>I am that I am,</em> <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup> Act. 17. 24. <em>God that made the world, and all things that are therin, ſeeing that he is the Lord of heauen and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands, neyther is worſhipped with mens hands,</em> as though hee needed any thing; <em>ſeeing he giueth to all life and breath, and all things.</em> <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>The perfection of his Nature, is either Simpleneſſe, or the Infiniteneſſe thereof.</p>
<p>The Simpleneſſe of his nature, is that by which hee is voide of all Logicall relation in arguments. He hath not in him ſubiect or adiunct. Ioh. 5. 26. <em>As the Father hath life in himſelfe, ſo hath he giuen to the Sonne to haue life in himſelfe:</em> conferred with Ioh. 14. 6. <em>I am the way, the truth, and the life.</em> 1. Ioh. 1. 7. <em>But if we walke in the light, as he is light:</em> conferred with v. 5. <em>God is</em> light, <em>and in him is no darknes.</em> Hence it is manifeſt that to haue Life, and to be Life: to be in Light, and to be Light, in God are all one. Neither is God ſubiect to generality, or ſpeciality: whole, or parts: matter or that which is made of matter: for ſo there ſhould bee in God diuers things, and one more perfect then another. Therefore, whatſoeuer is in God, is his eſſence, and all that he is, he is by eſſence. The ſaying of <em>Auguſtine</em> in his 6. book and 4. chap. of the Trinity, is fit to prooue this; <em>In God</em> (ſaith he) <em>to be, and to be iuſt or mightie, are all one: but in the mind of man, it is not all one to be, and to be mighty, or iuſt: for the mind may be deſtitute of theſe vertues, and yet a minde.</em></p>
<p>Hence it is manifeſt that the nature of God is immutable and ſpirituall.</p>
<p>Gods immutability of nature, is that by which he is voide of all compoſition, diuiſion, and change, Iam. 1. 17. <em>With God there is no variablenes nor ſhadow of changing.</em> Mal. 3. 6. <em>I am the Lord, and am not changed.</em> Where it is ſaid that God <em>repenteth, &amp;c.</em> Gen. 6. 6. the meaning is, that God changeth the action, as men doe that repent: therefore repentance ſignifieth not any mutation in God, but in his actions, and ſuch things as are made and changed by him.</p>
<p>Gods nature is ſpirituall, in that it is incorporal, and therefore inuiſible, Ioh. 4. 24. <em>God is a Spirit,</em> 2. Cor. 3. 17. <em>The Lord is the ſpirit.</em> 1. Tim. 1. 17. <em>To the King eternal, immortal, inuiſible only wiſe God, be glory &amp; honor for euer &amp; euer.</em> Col. 1. 15. <em>who is the image of the inuiſible God.</em></p>
<p>The infiniteneſſe of God is two-fold: his Eternitie, and exceeding greatneſſe.</p>
<p>Gods eternity, is that by which he is without beginning and ending. Pſal. 90. 2. <em>Before the mountaines were made, and before thou hadſt formed the earth and the round world, euen from euerlaſting to euerlaſting, thou art our God.</em> Reu. 1. 8. <em>I am</em> Alpha <em>and</em> Omega, <em>that is, the beginning and ending, ſaith the Lord: Which is, Which was, and Which is to come,</em></p>
<p>Gods exceeding greatnes, is that by which his incomprehenſible nature is euery where preſent, both within &amp; without the world. Pſ. 145. 3. <em>Great is the Lord &amp; worthy to be praiſed and his greatneſſe is incomprehenſible.</em> 1. King. 8. 27. <em>Is it true indeede that God will dwell on the earth? Behold the heauens, and the heauens of heauens are not able to containe thee: how much leſſe is this houſe that I haue built?</em> Ier. 23. 24. <em>Doe not I fill the heauen and earth, ſaith the Lord?</em> Hence it is plaine.</p>
<p>Firſt, that he is onely one, and that indiuiſible, not many, Eph. 4. 5. <em>One Lord, one faith, one baptiſme, one God and Father of all,</em> Deut. 4. 35. <em>Vnto thee it was ſhewed, that thou mighteſt know that the Lord he is God, and that there is none but he alone.</em> 1. Cor. 8. 4. <em>We know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one:</em> and there can be but one thing infinite in nature.</p>
<p>Secondly, that God is the knower of the heart. For nothing is hidden from that nature, which is within all things, and without all things, which is included in nothing, nor excluded from any thing. Becauſe. 1. <em>King.</em> 8. 39. <em>The Lord ſearcheth all hearts, and vnderſtandeth euery worke of the minde.</em> Pſal. 139. 1, 2. <em>Thou knoweſt my ſitting downe, and my riſing vp, thou vnderſtandeſt my cogitation afarre off.</em> <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#4">4</a></sup></p>
