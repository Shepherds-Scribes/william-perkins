<p>CHRISTIAN Reader, there are at this day foure ſeuerall opinions of the order of Gods Predeſtination. The firſt is, of the olde and new Pelagians; who place the cauſes of Gods Predeſtination in man; in that they holde, that God did ordaine men either to life or death, according as hee did fore-ſee, that they would by their naturall Free-will, eyther reiect or receiue grace offered. The ſecond of them, who (of ſome) are tearmed Lutherans; which teach, that God fore-ſeeing, how all mankinde being ſhut vp vnder beliefe, would therefore reiect grace offered, did hereupon purpoſe to chooſe ſome to ſaluation of his meere mercie, without any reſpect of their faith or good workes, and the reſt to reiect, beeing mooued to doe this, becauſe hee did eternally fore-ſee that they would reiect his grace offered them in the Goſpell. The third Semi-Pelagian Papiſts, which aſcribe Gods predeſtination, partly to mercy, and partly to mens fore-ſeene preparations and meritorious workes. The fourth, of ſuch as teach, that the cauſe of the execution of Gods predeſtination, is his mercy in Chriſt, in them which are ſaued; and in them which periſh, the fall and corruption of man: yet ſo, as that the decree and eternall counſell of God, concerning them both, hath not any cauſe beſides his will and pleaſure. Of theſe foure opinions, the three former I labour to oppugne, as erronious, and to maintaine the laſt, as being truth, which will beare weight in the ballance of the Sanctuary.</p>
<p>A further diſcourſe whereof, here I make bold to offer to thy godly conſideration: in reading whereof, regard not ſo much the thing it ſelfe penned very ſlenderly, as mine intent and affection: who deſire among the reſt, to caſt my mite into the treaſurie of the Church of <em>England</em>, and, for want of gold, pearle, and pretious ſtone, to bring a Rammes skinne or twaine, and a little Goates haire, to the building of the Lords tabernacle, <em>Exod.</em> 35. 23.</p>
<p>The Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt grant, that according to the riches of his glory, thou maiſt be ſtrengthened by his ſpirit in the inner man, that Chriſt may dwell in thy heart by faith; to the end that thou being rooted and grounded in loue, maieſt be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the breadth, and length, and height thereof; and to know the loue of Chriſt which paſſeth knowledge, that thou maieſt be filled with all fulneſſe of God. <em>Amen.</em> Farewell, <em>Iuly 23</em> the yeare of the laſt patience of Saints. 1592</p>

<p>THE Bodie of Scripture is a doctrine ſufficient to liue well.</p>
<p>It comprehendeth many holy ſciences, whereof one is principal, others are handmaids or retainers.</p>
<p>The principall ſcience is <em>Theologie</em>.</p>
<p><em>Theologie,</em> is the ſcience of liuing bleſſedly for euer. Bleſſed life ariſeth from the knowledge of God, Ioh. 17. 3. <em>This is life eternal, that they know thee to be the only very God, and whom thou haſt ſent Chriſt Ieſus.</em> Iſa. 53. 11. <em>By his knowledge ſhal my righteous ſeruant</em> (viz. Chriſt) <em>iuſtifie many.</em> And therefore it ariſeth likewiſe from the knowledge of our ſelues, becauſe we know God by looking into our ſelues.</p>
<p><em>Theologie</em> hath two parts: the firſt of God, the ſecond of his workes.</p>

<p>God is Iehouah Elohim, Exod. 6. 2, 3. <em>And Elohim ſpake vnto Moſes, and ſaid vnto him, I am Iehouah: and I appeared vnto Abraham, to Iſaac, and to Iacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name</em> Iehouah, <em>was I not knowne vnto them.</em> Exod. 3. 13. <em>If they ſay vnto me, what is his name?

<p>The perfection of the nature of God, is the abſolute conſtitution thereof, whereby it is wholly complete within it ſelfe, Exod. 3. 13. <em>I am that I am,</em> <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup> Act. 17. 24. <em>God that made the world, and all things that are therin, ſeeing that he is the Lord of heauen and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands, neyther is worſhipped with mens hands,</em> as though hee needed any thing; <em>ſeeing he giueth to all life and breath, and all things.</em> <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>The perfection of his Nature, is either Simpleneſſe, or the Infiniteneſſe thereof.</p>
<p>The Simpleneſſe of his nature, is that by which hee is voide of all Logicall relation in arguments. He hath not in him ſubiect or adiunct. Ioh. 5. 26. <em>As the Father hath life in himſelfe, ſo hath he giuen to the Sonne to haue life in himſelfe:</em> conferred with Ioh. 14. 6. <em>I am the way, the truth, and the life.</em> 1. Ioh. 1. 7. <em>But if we walke in the light, as he is light:</em> conferred with v. 5. <em>God is</em> light, <em>and in him is no darknes.</em> Hence it is manifeſt that to haue Life, and to be Life: to be in Light, and to be Light, in God are all one. Neither is God ſubiect to generality, or ſpeciality: whole, or parts: matter or that which is made of matter: for ſo there ſhould bee in God diuers things, and one more perfect then another. Therefore, whatſoeuer is in God, is his eſſence, and all that he is, he is by eſſence. The ſaying of <em>Auguſtine</em> in his 6. book and 4. chap. of the Trinity, is fit to prooue this; <em>In God</em> (ſaith he) <em>to be, and to be iuſt or mightie, are all one: but in the mind of man, it is not all one to be, and to be mighty, or iuſt: for the mind may be deſtitute of theſe vertues, and yet a minde.</em></p>
<p>Hence it is manifeſt that the nature of God is immutable and ſpirituall.</p>
<p>Gods immutability of nature, is that by which he is voide of all compoſition, diuiſion, and change, Iam. 1. 17. <em>With God there is no variablenes nor ſhadow of changing.</em> Mal. 3. 6. <em>I am the Lord, and am not changed.</em> Where it is ſaid that God <em>repenteth, &amp;c.</em> Gen. 6. 6. the meaning is, that God changeth the action, as men doe that repent: therefore repentance ſignifieth not any mutation in God, but in his actions, and ſuch things as are made and changed by him.</p>
<p>Gods nature is ſpirituall, in that it is incorporal, and therefore inuiſible, Ioh. 4. 24. <em>God is a Spirit,</em> 2. Cor. 3. 17. <em>The Lord is the ſpirit.</em> 1. Tim. 1. 17. <em>To the King eternal, immortal, inuiſible only wiſe God, be glory &amp; honor for euer &amp; euer.</em> Col. 1. 15. <em>who is the image of the inuiſible God.</em></p>
<p>The infiniteneſſe of God is two-fold: his Eternitie, and exceeding greatneſſe.</p>
<p>Gods eternity, is that by which he is without beginning and ending. Pſal. 90. 2. <em>Before the mountaines were made, and before thou hadſt formed the earth and the round world, euen from euerlaſting to euerlaſting, thou art our God.</em> Reu. 1. 8. <em>I am</em> Alpha <em>and</em> Omega, <em>that is, the beginning and ending, ſaith the Lord: Which is, Which was, and Which is to come,</em></p>
<p>Gods exceeding greatnes, is that by which his incomprehenſible nature is euery where preſent, both within &amp; without the world. Pſ. 145. 3. <em>Great is the Lord &amp; worthy to be praiſed and his greatneſſe is incomprehenſible.</em> 1. King. 8. 27. <em>Is it true indeede that God will dwell on the earth? Behold the heauens, and the heauens of heauens are not able to containe thee: how much leſſe is this houſe that I haue built?</em> Ier. 23. 24. <em>Doe not I fill the heauen and earth, ſaith the Lord?</em> Hence it is plaine.</p>
<p>Firſt, that he is onely one, and that indiuiſible, not many, Eph. 4. 5. <em>One Lord, one faith, one baptiſme, one God and Father of all,</em> Deut. 4. 35. <em>Vnto thee it was ſhewed, that thou mighteſt know that the Lord he is God, and that there is none but he alone.</em> 1. Cor. 8. 4. <em>We know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one:</em> and there can be but one thing infinite in nature.</p>
<p>Secondly, that God is the knower of the heart. For nothing is hidden from that nature, which is within all things, and without all things, which is included in nothing, nor excluded from any thing. Becauſe. 1. <em>King.</em> 8. 39. <em>The Lord ſearcheth all hearts, and vnderſtandeth euery worke of the minde.</em> Pſal. 139. 1, 2. <em>Thou knoweſt my ſitting downe, and my riſing vp, thou vnderſtandeſt my cogitation afarre off.</em> <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>HItherto we haue ſpoken of the perfection of Gods nature: Now followeth the life of GOD, by which the Diuine Nature is in perpetuall action, liuing, and moouing in it ſelfe. Pſal. 42. 2. <em>My ſoule thirſteth for God, euen for the liuing God, when ſhall I come and appeare before the preſence of God?</em> Heb. 3. 12. <em>See there be not at any time in any of you an euill heart to depart from the liuing God.</em></p>
<p>The diuine Nature, is eſpecially in perpetuall operation by three attributes, the which doe manifeſt the operation of God towards his creatures. Theſe are his Wiſedome, Will, and Omnipotencie.</p>
<p>The wiſedome or knowledge of God, is that by the which God doth, not by certaine notions abſtracted from the things themſelues, but by his owne eſſence: nor ſucceſsiuely and by diſcourſe of reaſon, but by one eternall and immutable act of vnderſtanding, diſtinctly and perfectly know himſelfe, and all other things, though infinite, whether they haue bin or not. Math. 11. 27. <em>No man knoweth the Sonne but the Father, nor the Father but the Sonne, and he to whom the Sonne will reueale him.</em> Heb. 4. 13. <em>There is nothing created, which is not manifeſt in his ſight: but all things are naked and open to his eyes, with whom we haue to do,</em> Pſal. 147:5. <em>His wiſedome is infinite.</em></p>
<p>Gods wiſedome hath theſe parts: his foreknowledge, and his counſell.</p>
<p>The foreknowledge of God, is that by which he moſt aſſuredly foreſeeth all things that are to come. Act. 2. 23. <em>Him haue ye taken by the hands of the wicked, being deliuered by the determinate counſell and foreknowledge of God, and haue crucified and ſlaine.</em> Rom. 8. 29. <em>Thoſe which he knew before, he alſo predeſtinated to be made like to the image of his Sonne.</em> This is not properly ſpoken of God, but by reaſon of men to whom things are paſt or to come.</p>
<p>The counſell of God, is that by the which he doth moſt rightly perceiue the beſt reaſon of all things that are done. Prou. 8. 14. <em>I haue counſell and wiſedome, I am vnderſtanding, and I haue ſtrength.</em></p>
<p>The will of God, is that by the which he both moſt freely, and iuſtly with one act willeth all things. Rom. 9. 18. <em>He hath mercie on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth.</em> Eph. 1. 5. <em>Who hath predeſtinate vs to be adopted through Ieſus Chriſt vnto himſelfe, according to the good pleaſure of his will.</em> Iam. 4. 15. <em>For that which you ſhould ſay, If the Lord will, and we liue we will doe this or that.</em></p>
<p>God willeth that which is good, by approuing it; that which is euill, in as much as it is euill, by diſallowing and forſaking it. And yet he voluntarily doth permit euill; becauſe it is good that there ſhould be euill. Act. 14. 16. <em>Who in time paſt ſuffered all the Gentiles to walke in their owne waies.</em> Pſal. 81. 12. <em>So I gaue them vp to the hardnes of their heart, and they haue walked in their owne counſels.</em></p>
<p>The will of God, by reaſon of diuers obiects, hath diuers Names, and is either called Loue and Hatred, or Grace and Iuſtice.</p>
<p>The Loue of God is that, by the which God approoueth firſt himſelfe, and then all his creatures as they are good, without their deſert, and in them doth take delight. 1. Ioh. 4. 16. <em>God is loue, and who ſo remaineth in loue, remaineth in God, and God in him.</em> Ioh. 3. 16. <em>So God loued the world, that he gaue his onely begotten Sonne, &amp;c.</em> Rom. 5. 8. <em>God ſetteth out his loue towards vs, ſeeing that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for vs.</em></p>
<p>The Hatred of God, is that by the which he diſliketh and deteſteth his creature offending, for his fault. 1 Cor. 10. 5. <em>But many of thé the Lord miſliked, for they periſhed in the wildernes.</em> Pſ. 5. 5. <em>Thou hateſt al the workers of iniquity.</em> Pſ. 45. 7. <em>Thou haſt loued iuſtice &amp; hated iniquity.</em></p>
<p>The grace of God, is that by which he freely declareth his fauour to his creatures. Rom. 11. 6. <em>If it be of grace, it is no more of workes: otherwiſe grace is not grace; but if it be of works it is no more grace.</em> Tit. 2. 11. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> <em>The ſauing grace of God ſhined to all men, teaching vs to deny impietie, &amp;c.</em></p>
<p>The Grace of God, is either his goodneſſe, or his mercie.</p>
<p>The Goodneſſe of God, is that by which he being in himſelfe abſolutely good, doth freely exerciſe his liberalitie vpon his creatures, Matth. 19. 17. <em>Why calleſt thou mee good? there is none good but one, euen God.</em> Math. 5. 45. <em>He maketh Sunne to ſhine vpon the good and bad, and he raineth vpon the iuſt and vniuſt.</em></p>
<p>Gods mercie, is that by which he freely aſſiſteth all his creatures in their miſeries. Eſa. 30. 18. <em>Yet will the Lord waite, that he may haue mercy vpon you.</em> Lam. 3. 22. <em>It is the Lords mercy that we are not conſumed, becauſe his compaſſions faile not.</em> Exod. 33. 19. <em>I take pitie on whom I take pitie, and am mercifull to whom I am mercifull.</em></p>
<p>Gods iuſtice, is that by which he in all things willeth that which is iuſt. Pſal. 11. 7. <em>The iuſt Lord loueth iuſtice.</em> Pſal. 5. 4. <em>For thou art not a God that loueth wickedneſſe.</em></p>
<p>Gods iuſtice is in word or deede.</p>
<p>Iuſtice in word, is that truth by which he conſtantly, and indeede willeth that which he hath ſaid. Rom. 3. 4. <em>Let God be true, and euery man a lyar.</em> Math. 24. 35. <em>Heauen and earth ſhall paſſe away, but my word ſhall not paſſe away.</em> Hence it is, that there is a certaine iuſtice of God in keeping his promiſe. 1. Ioh. 1. 9. <em>If we confeſſe our ſinnes, God is faithfull and iuſt to forgiue our ſinnes,</em> 2. Tim. 4. 8. <em>Henceforth is laid vp for mee the crowne of righteouſneſſe, which the Lord the righteous iudge ſhal giue me at that day</em></p>
<p>Iuſtice in deede, is that by which he either diſpoſeth or rewardeth.</p>
<p>Gods diſpoſing Iuſtice, is that by which he, as a moſt free Lord, ordereth rightly al things in his actions. Pſal. 145. 17. <em>The Lord is righteous in all his waies.</em></p>
<p>Gods rewarding Iuſtice, is that by which he rendreth to his creature according to his worke. 2. Theſſ. 1. 6. <em>It is iuſtice with God, to render affliction to ſuch as afflict you, but to you which are afflicted, releaſing with vs.</em> <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup> 1. Pet. 1. 17. <em>Therefore if you call him Father, which without reſpect of perſon iudgeth according to euery mans worke, paſſe the time of your dwelling here in feare.</em> Ierem. 51. 56. <em>The Lord that recompenſeth, ſhall ſurely recompence.</em></p>
<p>The Iuſtice of God, is either his Gentlenes or Anger.</p>
<p>Gods Gentleneſſe, is that by which he freely rewardeth the righteouſneſſe of his creature. 2. Theſ. 1. 5. <em>Which is a token of the righteous iudgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy the kingdome of God, for the which ye alſo ſuffer.</em> Mat. 10. 41, 42. <em>He that receiueth a Prophet, in the name of a Prophet: ſhall haue a Prophets reward: and he that receiueth a righteous man, in the name of a righteous man, ſhall haue the reward of a righteous man. And whoſoeuer ſhall giue vnto one of theſe little ones to drink a cup of cold water onely in the name of a Diſciple, verily I ſay vnto you, he ſhall not loſe his reward.</em></p>
<p>Gods Anger is that by which he willeth the puniſhment of the creature offending, Rom. 1. 18. <em>For the wrath of God is reuealed from heauen againſt all vngodlineſſe, and vnrighteouſneſſe of men, which withhold the truth in vnrighteouſneſſe.</em> Ioh. 3. 36. <em>He that obeyeth not the Sonne, ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</em></p>
<p>Thus much concerning the will of GOD; Now followeth his Omnipotencie.</p>
<p>Gods Omnipotencie, is that by which hee is moſt able to performe euery worke. Math. 19. 26. <em>With men this is impoſſible, but with God all things are poſſible.</em></p>
<p>Some things notwithſtanding are heere to be excepted. Firſt, thoſe things whoſe action argueth an impotencie, as to lie, to denie his word. Tit. 1. 2. <em>Which God, that cannot lie, hath promiſed.</em> 2. Tim. 2. 1. 3. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3">3</a></sup> <em>He cannot denie himſelfe.</em> Secondly, ſuch things as are contrary to the nature of God, as to deſtroy himſelfe, and not to beget his Sonne from eternity. Thirdly, ſuch things as imply contradiction. For God cannot make a truth falſe; or that which is when it is not, to be.</p>
<p>Gods power may be diſtinguiſhed into an abſolute and actuall power.</p>
<p>Gods abſolute power, is that by which he can doe more, then he either doth or will doe. Matth. 3. 9. <em>I ſay vnto you, God is able of theſe ſtones to raiſe vp children to Abraham.</em> Phil. 3. 21. <em>According to the working, whereby he is able to ſubdue euen all things to himſelfe.</em></p>
<p>Gods actuall power, is that by which hee cauſeth all things to be, which he freely willeth. Pſal. 135. 6. <em>Al things which God wil, thoſe he doth in heauen, and in earth, and in all depths.</em></p>

<p>OVt of the former attributes, by which the true Iehouah is diſtinguiſhed from a fained God, and from Idols, ariſe the glorie of God, and his bleſſedneſſe.</p>
<p>Gods glorie or maieſtie, is the infinite excellencie of his moſt ſimple and moſt holy diuine Nature. Heb. 1. 3. <em>Who being the brightnes of his glorie, and the ingraued forme of his perſon, &amp;c.</em> Nehem. 9. 5. Let them praiſe thy glorious name, O God, which excelleſt aboue all thankeſgiuing and praiſe.</p>
<p>By this we ſee, that God onely can know himſelfe perfectly. Ioh. 6. 46. <em>Not that any man hath ſeene the Father, ſaue he which is of God, he hath ſeen the Father.</em> 1. Tim. 6. 16. <em>Who only hath immortalitie, and dwelleth in the light that none can attaine vnto, whom neuer man ſaw, neither can ſee.</em> Exod. 33. 20. <em>Thou canſt not ſee my face.</em></p>
<p>Notwithſtanding there is a certaine manifeſtation of Gods glory: partly more obſcure, partly more apparent.</p>
<p>The more obſcure manifeſtation, is the viſion of Gods maieſtie in this life, by the eyes of the minde through the helpe of things perceiued by outward ſenſes. Iſa. 6. 1. <em>I ſaw the Lord ſitting vpon an high throne, and lifted vp, and the lower parts therof filled the Temple.</em> Exod. 33. 22. <em>And while my glory paſſeth by, I will put thee in a cleft of the Rocke, and will couer thee with my hand whiles I paſſe by: after I will take away mine hand, and thou ſhalt ſee my backe parts, but my face ſhall not be ſeene.</em> 1. Cor. 13. 12. <em>Now we ſee as through a glaſſe darkely.</em></p>
<p>The more apparent manifeſtation of God, is the contemplation of him in heauen face to face. 1. Cor. 13. 12. <em>But then ſhall we ſee face to face.</em> Dan. 7. 9, 10. <em>I beheld till the thrones were ſet vp, and the ancient of daies did ſit, whoſe garment was white as ſnow, &amp;c.</em></p>
<p>Gods bleſſednes, is that by which God is in himſelfe, and of himſelfe all-ſufficient. Gen. 17. 1. <em>I am God all-ſufficient, walke before me, and be thou vpright.</em> Col. 2. 9. <em>For in him dwels all the fulneſſe of the Godhead bodily.</em> 1 Tim. 6. 15. <em>Which in due time he ſhall ſhew, that is bleſſed and Prince only.</em></p>
