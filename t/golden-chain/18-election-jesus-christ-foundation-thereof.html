<p>PRedeſtination hath two parts: Election and Reprobation. 1. Theſſ. 5. 9. <em>God hath not appointed vs to wrath, but to obtaine ſaluation by the meanes of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</em></p>
<p>Election, is Gods decree, whereby on his owne free-will, he hath ordained certain men to ſaluation, to the praiſe of the glorie of his grace. Eph. 1. 4, 5, 6. <em>He hath choſen vs in him, before the foundation of the world, according to the good pleaſure of his will, to the praiſe of the glory of his grace.</em></p>
<p>This decree is that booke of life, wherein are written the names of the Elect. Reu. 20. 12. <em>Another booke was opened, which is the booke of life, and the dead were iudged of thoſe things, that were written in the bookes according to their workes.</em> 2. Tim. 2. 10. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> <em>The foundation of God remaineth ſure, and hath this ſeale, the Lord knoweth who are his.</em></p>
<p>The execution of this decree, is an action, by which God, euen as hee purpoſed with himſelfe, worketh all thoſe things effectually, which hee decreed for the ſaluation of the Elect. For they whom God elected to this end, that they ſhould inherite eternall life, were alſo elected to thoſe ſubordinate meanes, whereby, as by ſteppes, they might attain this ende: and without which, it were impoſsible to obtaine it. Rom. 8. 29. 30. <em>Thoſe which hee knew before, he alſo predeſtinate to be made like to the image of his Sonne, that hee might be the firſt borne amongſt many brethren: Moreouer, whom he predeſtinate, them he called, whom hee called, them he iuſtified, and whom he iuſtified, them alſo he glorified.</em></p>
<p>There appertaine three things to the execution of this decree. Firſt, the foundation. Secondly, the meanes. Thirdly, the degrees.</p>
<p>The foundation is Chriſt Ieſus, called of his Father from all eternitie, to performe the office of the Mediatour, that in him all thoſe which ſhould bee ſaued, might bee choſen. Heb. 5. 5. <em>Chriſt tooke not to himſelfe this honor, to bee made the high Prieſt, but he that ſaid vnto him, Thou art my Sonne, this day begat I thee, gaue it him, &amp;c.</em> Eſa. 42. 1. <em>Beholde my ſeruant: I haue put my ſpirit vpon him, he ſhall bring forth iudgement to the Gentiles.</em> Eph. 1. 4. <em>Hee hath choſen vs in him,</em> meaning Chriſt.</p>
<p><em>Queſtion.</em> How can Chriſt bee ſubordinate vnto Gods election, ſeeing hee together with the Father decree all things?</p>
<p><em>A.</em> Chriſt as he is a Mediator, is not ſuboridnate to the very decree it ſelfe of election but to the execution therof only. 1. Pet. 1. 20. <em>Chriſt was ordained before the foundation of the world.</em> Auguſtine in his booke of the Predeſtination of the Saints, cha. 15. <em>Chriſt was predeſtinate that he might be our head.</em></p>
<p>In Chriſt, wee muſt eſpecially obſerue two things, his Incarnation, and his Office.</p>
<p>To the working of his Incarnation, concurre three things: firſt, both his Natures: ſecondly, their Vnion: thirdly, their diſtinction.</p>
<p>Chriſts firſt Nature, is the Godhead, in as much as it belongeth to the Sonne, whereby hee is God. Philipians 2. 6. <em>Who being in the forme of God, thought it no robbery to bee equall with God.</em> Ioh. 1. 1. <em>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and that Word was God.</em></p>
<p>It was requiſite for the Mediator to be God; 1. That he might the better ſuſtaine that great miſery, wherewith mankinde was ouerwhelmed; the greatnes whereof, theſe foure things declare: I. The grieuouſneſſe of ſinne, wherewith Gods Maieſty was infinitely offended. II. Gods infinite anger againſt this ſin. III. The fearefull power of death. IV. The diuels tyranny, who is prince of this world. 2. That hee might make his humane nature both of plentifull merit, and alſo of ſufficient efficacy, for the work of mans redemption. 3. That he might inſtill into all the elect eternall life, and holineſſe. Eſa. 43. 12. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup> <em>I am the Lord and there is none beſides me a Sauiour, I haue declared, and I haue ſaued, and I haue ſhewed, when there was no ſtrange god among you; therefore ye are my witneſſes, ſaith the Lord, that I am God.</em></p>
<p>I ſay, <em>the Godhead,</em> as it is the Godhead of the Sonne, is Chriſts diuine Nature: not as it is the Godhead of the Father, or of the holy Ghoſt: for it is the office of the Son, to haue the adminiſtration of euery outward action of the Trinity, from the Father, by the holy Ghoſt. 1. <em>Cor.</em> 8. 6. And he beeing by nature the Sonne of the Father, beſtoweth this priuiledge on thoſe that beleeue, that they are the ſonnes of God by adoption. <em>Ioh.</em> 1. 12. <em>As many as receiued him, to them hee gaue power to bee the ſonnes of God.</em></p>
<p>If either the Father, or the H. Ghoſt ſhould haue bin incarnate, the title of Sonne ſhould haue bin giuen to one of them, who was not the Sonne by eternal generation: and ſo there ſhould be more ſonnes then one.</p>
<p>Chriſts other nature, is his humanity, whereby hee, the Mediatour is very man. 1. Tim. 2. 5. <em>One God, and one Mediatour betweene God and man, the man Chriſt Ieſus.</em></p>
<p>It was neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould bee man. Firſt, that God might be pacified in that nature, whereby he was offended. Secondly, that he might vndergoe puniſhment due to ſin, the which the Godhead could not, being voide and free from all paſsion.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Chriſt, as he is man, is like vnto vs in all things, ſinne onely excepted. Heb. 2. 17. <em>In all things it became him to bee made like vnto his brethren.</em> 2. Cor. 13. 4.</p>
<p>Chriſt therfore is a perfect man, conſiſting of an eſſentiall and true ſoule and body, wherunto are ioyned ſuch faculties and properties, as are eſſentiall vnto both. In his ſoule, is vnderſtanding, memorie, will, and ſuch like: in his bodie, length, breadth, and thickneſſe: yea, it is comprehended in one onely place, viſible, ſubiect to feeling, neither is there any thing wanting in him which may either adorne or make for the beeing of mans nature.</p>
<p>Againe, Chriſt in his humanity, was ſubiect to the infirmities of mans nature, which are theſe: I. To be tempted, Matth. 4. 1. <em>Ieſus was carried by the ſpirit into the deſart, to be tempted of the diuell.</em> II. To feare. Heb. 5. 7. <em>Who in the daies of his fleſh, did offer vp prayers and ſupplications with ſtrong crying and teares, vnto him that was able to ſaue him from death, and was alſo heard in that which he feared.</em> III. To bee angrie. Marke 3. 5. <em>Then hee looked round about on them angerly, mourning alſo for the hardneſſe of their hearts, and ſaid vnto the man, Stretch forth thine hand.</em> IV. Forgetfulneſſe of his office impoſed vpon him, by reaſon of the agonie aſtoniſhing his ſenſes. Matth. 26. 39. <em>He went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, ſaying, O Father, if it be poſſible, let this cuppe paſſe from mee: neuertheleſſe, not as I will, but as thou wilt.</em></p>
<p>Wee muſt hold theſe things concerning Chriſts infirmities: I. They were ſuch qualities, as did onely affect his humane nature, and not at all conſtitute the ſame: and therefore might be left of Chriſt. II. They were ſuch as were common to all men: as to thirſt, to be wearie, and ſubiect to die: and not perſonall, as are Agues, Conſumptions, the Leproſie, Blindneſſe, &amp;c. III. He was ſubiect to theſe infirmities, not by neceſsity of his humane nature, but by his free-wil and pleaſure, pitying mankind. Therefore in him ſuch infirmities were not the puniſhment of his owne ſinne, as they are in vs; but rather part of that his humiliation which he did willingly vndergoe for our ſakes.</p>
